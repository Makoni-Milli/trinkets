IT  may  not,  perhaps,  be  out  of  place  in  this  new  edition  of 
Three Men in a Boat to place before its readers the enormous 
hold it has upon the reading public in Great Britain and her 
colonies.  Originally  published  in  August,  1889,  it  has  been 
year  after  year  reprinted,  until  there  has  been  produced  the 
large  number  of  202,000  copies. Adding  to  this  the  5,000  of 
the present edition, a total is reached of 207,000 copies. It is 
remarkable  that  during  this  period  there  has  been  only  one 
edition, and this published at the price of 3s. 6d.; the publisher 
ventures to believe this is unprecedented. It is not as though, as 
is too often the case with an ordinary novel, an enormous sale 
took place during a few months and then ceased, inasmuch as 
in the present case there has been, and still is, a constant and 
steady sale year after year. The present opportunity has been 
taken to re-set in new type the letterpress, and to re-engrave 
(from the originals) the whole of the drawings. The publisher 
trusts that Three Men in a Boat, appealing as it does so much 
to human nature both in its pathos and its humour, will still 
continue  its  pleasant  voyage,  and  find  new  friends  in  every 
home in the land which gave it birth.

AUTHOR’S ADVERTISEMENT.

MY Publisher suggests my adding a few lines to his. To refuse 
to  do  so,  under  the  circumstances,  might  appear  surly.  The 
world has been very kind to this book. Mr. Arrowsmith speaks 
only of its sales in Great Britain. In Chicago, I was assured by 
an enterprising pirate now retired, that the sales throughout 
the  United  States  had  exceeded  a  million;  and  although,  in 
consequence  of  its  having  been  published  before  the  Copy-
right Convention, this has brought me no material advantage, 
the fame and popularity it has won for me among the Ameri-
can public is an asset not to be despised. It has been translated 
into,  I  think,  every  European  language  except  Arabian,  also 
into some of those of Asia. It has brought me many thousands 
of letters from young folk, from old folk; from well folk, from 
sick  folk;  from  merry  folk,  from  sad  folk.  They  have  come 
to me from all parts of the world, from men and women of 
all countries. Had these letters been the only result I should 
feel glad and proud that I had written the book. I retain a few 
blackened pages of one copy sent me by a young colonial of-
ficer from South Africa. They were taken from the knapsack 
of a dead comrade found on Spion Kop. So much for testimo-
nials. It remains only to explain the merits justifying such an 
extraordinary success. I am quite unable to do so. I have writ-
ten books that have appeared to me more clever, books that 
have appeared to me more humorous. But it is as the author of 
Three Men in a Boat (to say nothing of the Dog) that the public 
persists in remembering me. Certain writers used to suggest 
that it was the vulgarity of the book, its entire absence of hu-
mour, that accounted for its success with the people; but one 
feels by this time that such suggestion does not solve the rid-

dle. Bad art may succeed for a time and with a limited public; 
it does not go on extending its circle throughout twenty years. 
I have come to the conclusion that, be the explanation what it 
may, I can take credit to myself for having written this book. 
That is, if I did write it. For really I hardly remember doing so. 
I remember only feeling very young and absurdly pleased with 
myself  for  reasons  that  concern  only  myself.  It  was  summer 
time,  and  London  is  so  beautiful  in  summer.  It  lay  beneath 
my  window  a  fairy  city  veiled  in  golden  mist,  for  I  worked 
in a room high up above the chimney-pots; and at night the 
lights shone far beneath me, so that I looked down as into an 
Aladdin’s cave of jewels. It was during those summer months I 
wrote this book; it seemed the only thing to do.

PREFACE.

The chief beauty of this book lies not, so much in its literary 
style, or in the extent and usefulness of the information it con-
veys, as in its simple truthfulness. Its pages form the record of 
events that really happened. All that has been done is to colour 
them;  and,  for  this,  no  extra  charge  has  been  made.  George 
and Harris and Montmorency are not Poetic ideals, but things 
of  flesh  and  blood — especially  George,  who  weighs  about 
twelve stone. Other works may excel this in depth of thought 
and knowledge of human nature: other books may rival it in 
originality and size; but, for hopeless and incurable veracity, 
nothing yet discovered can surpass it. This, more than all its 
other charms, will, it is felt, make the volume precious in the 
eye of the earnest reader; and will lend additional weight to 
the lesson that the story teaches.

LONDON, August, 1889

CHAPTER I.

Three Invalids. — Sufferings of George and Harris. — A victim to 
one hundred and seven fatal maladies. — Useful prescriptions. — 
Cure for liver complaint in children. — We agree that we are over-
worked,  and  need  rest. — A  week  on  the  rolling  deep? — George 
suggests the river. — Montmorency lodges an objection. — Original 

motion carried by majority of three to one.

THERE were four of us — George, and William Samuel Harris, 
and myself, and Montmorency. We were sitting in my room, 
smoking,  and  talking  about  how  bad  we  were — bad  from  a 
medical point of view I mean, of course.

We were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous 
about it. Harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness 
come over him at times, that he hardly knew what he was do-
ing; and then George said that he had fits of giddiness too, and 
hardly knew what he was doing. With me, it was my liver that 
was out of order. I knew it was my liver that was out of order, 
because I had just been reading a patent liver-pill circular, in 
which  were  detailed  the  various  symptoms  by  which  a  man 
could tell when his liver was out of order. I had them all.

It is a most extraordinary thing, but I never read a patent 
medicine  advertisement  without  being  impelled  to  the  con-
clusion that I am suffering from the particular disease therein 
dealt with in its most virulent form. The diagnosis seems in 
every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that I 
have ever felt.

I remember going to the British Museum one day to read 
up  the  treatment  for  some  slight  ailment  of  which  I  had  a 
touch — hay  fever,  I  fancy  it  was.  I  got  down  the  book,  and 
read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I 
idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases, 
generally.  I  forget  which  was  the  first  distemper  I  plunged 
into — some fearful, devastating scourge, I know — and, before 
I had glanced half down the list of “premonitory symptoms,” it 
was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.

I  sat  for  awhile,  frozen  with  horror;  and  then,  in  the  list-

— 10 —

lessness  of  despair,  I  again  turned  over  the  pages.  I  came  to 
typhoid  fever — read  the  symptoms — discovered  that  I  had 
typhoid  fever,  must  have  had  it  for  months  without  know-
ing  it — wondered  what  else  I  had  got;  turned  up  St. Vitus’s 
Dance — found, as I expected, that I had that too, — began to 
get interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bot-
tom, and so started alphabetically — read up ague, and learnt 
that  I  was  sickening  for  it,  and  that  the  acute  stage  would 
commence in about another fortnight. Bright’s disease, I was 
relieved to find, I had only in a modified form, and, so far as 
that was concerned, I might live for years. Cholera I had, with 
severe  complications;  and  diphtheria  I  seemed  to  have  been 
born with. I plodded conscientiously through the twenty-six 
letters, and the only malady I could conclude I had not got was 
housemaid’s knee.

I felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to 
be a sort of slight. Why hadn’t I got housemaid’s knee? Why 
this invidious reservation? After a while, however, less grasp-
ing feelings prevailed. I reflected that I had every other known 
malady in the pharmacology, and I grew less selfish, and deter-
mined to do without housemaid’s knee. Gout, in its most ma-
lignant stage, it would appear, had seized me without my being 
aware of it; and zymosis I had evidently been suffering with 
from boyhood. There were no more diseases after zymosis, so 
I concluded there was nothing else the matter with me.

I  sat  and  pondered.  I  thought  what  an  interesting  case  I 
must be from a medical point of view, what an acquisition I 
should be to a class! Students would have no need to “walk the 
hospitals,” if they had me. I was a hospital in myself. All they 
need do would be to walk round me, and, after that, take their 
diploma.

Then I wondered how long I had to live. I tried to examine 
myself. I felt my pulse. I could not at first feel any pulse at all. 
Then, all of a sudden, it seemed to start off. I pulled out my 
watch  and  timed  it.  I  made  it  a  hundred  and  forty-seven  to 
the minute. I tried to feel my heart. I could not feel my heart. 

— 11 —

It had stopped beating. I have since been induced to come to 
the opinion that it must have been there all the time, and must 
have been beating, but I cannot account for it. I patted myself 
all over my front, from what I call my waist up to my head, and 
I went a bit round each side, and a little way up the back. But 
I could not feel or hear anything. I tried to look at my tongue. 
I stuck it out as far as ever it would go, and I shut one eye, and 
tried to examine it with the other. I could only see the tip, and 
the  only  thing  that  I  could  gain  from  that  was  to  feel  more 
certain than before that I had scarlet fever.

I had walked into that reading-room a happy, healthy man. I 

crawled out a decrepit wreck.

I went to my medical man. He is an old chum of mine, and 
feels  my  pulse,  and  looks  at  my  tongue,  and  talks  about  the 
weather,  all  for  nothing,  when  I  fancy  I’m  ill;  so  I  thought  I 
would do him a good turn by going to him now. “What a doc-
tor wants,” I said, “is practice. He shall have me. He will get 
more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your 
ordinary, commonplace patients, with only one or two diseases 
each.” So I went straight up and saw him, and he said:

“Well, what’s the matter with you?”
I said:
“I will not take up your time, dear boy, with telling you what 
is the matter with me. Life is brief, and you might pass away 
before I had finished. But I will tell you what is not the matter 
with me. I have not got housemaid’s knee. Why I have not got 
housemaid’s knee, I cannot tell you; but the fact remains that I 
have not got it. Everything else, however, I have got.”

And I told him how I came to discover it all.
Then he opened me and looked down me, and clutched hold 
of my wrist, and then he hit me over the chest when I wasn’t 
expecting it — a cowardly thing to do, I call it — and immedi-
ately afterwards butted me with the side of his head. After that, 
he sat down and wrote out a prescription, and folded it up and 
gave it me, and I put it in my pocket and went out.

— 12 —

I  did  not  open  it.  I  took  it  to  the  nearest  chemist’s,  and 

handed it in. The man read it, and then handed it back.

He said he didn’t keep it.
I said:
“You are a chemist?”
He said:
“I am a chemist. If I was a co-operative stores and family 
hotel  combined,  I  might  be  able  to  oblige  you.  Being  only  a 
chemist hampers me.”

I read the prescription. It ran:

“1 lb. beefsteak, with
1 pt. bitter beer
                        every 6 hours.
1 ten-mile walk every morning.
1 bed at 11 sharp every night.
And don’t stuff up your head with
things you don’t understand.”

I followed the directions, with the happy result — speaking 

for myself — that my life was preserved, and is still going on.

In the present instance, going back to the liver-pill circular, 
I had the symptoms, beyond all mistake, the chief among them 
being “a general disinclination to work of any kind.”

What I suffer in that way no tongue can tell. From my ear-
liest infancy I have been a martyr to it. As a boy, the disease 
hardly ever left me for a day. They did not know, then, that it 
was my liver. Medical science was in a far less advanced state 
than now, and they used to put it down to laziness.

“Why, you skulking little devil, you,” they would say, “get up 
and do something for your living, can’t you?” — not knowing, 
of course, that I was ill.

And they didn’t give me pills; they gave me clumps on the 
side of the head. And, strange as it may appear, those clumps 
on the head often cured me — for the time being. I have known 
one clump on the head have more effect upon my liver, and 

— 13 —

make me feel more anxious to go straight away then and there, 
and do what was wanted to be done, without further loss of 
time, than a whole box of pills does now.

You know, it often is so — those simple, old-fashioned rem-
edies are sometimes more efficacious than all the dispensary 
stuff.

We sat there for half-an-hour, describing to each other our 
maladies. I explained to George and William Harris how I felt 
when I got up in the morning, and William Harris told us how 
he felt when he went to bed; and George stood on the hearth-
rug, and gave us a clever and powerful piece of acting, illustra-
tive of how he felt in the night.

George fancies he is ill; but there’s never anything really the 

matter with him, you know.

At this point, Mrs. Poppets knocked at the door to know if 
we were ready for supper. We smiled sadly at one another, and 
said  we  supposed  we  had  better  try  to  swallow  a  bit.  Harris 
said a little something in one’s stomach often kept the disease 
in check; and Mrs. Poppets brought the tray in, and we drew 
up to the table, and toyed with a little steak and onions, and 
some rhubarb tart.

I  must  have  been  very  weak  at  the  time;  because  I  know, 
after  the  first  half-hour  or  so,  I  seemed  to  take  no  interest 
whatever in my food — an unusual thing for me — and I didn’t 
want any cheese.

This  duty  done,  we  refilled  our  glasses,  lit  our  pipes,  and 
resumed the discussion upon our state of health. What it was 
that was actually the matter with us, we none of us could be 
sure of; but the unanimous opinion was that it — whatever it 
was — had been brought on by overwork.

“What we want is rest,” said Harris.
“Rest and a complete change,” said George. “The overstrain 
upon our brains has produced a general depression through-
out the system. Change of scene, and absence of the necessity 
for thought, will restore the mental equilibrium.”

George has a cousin, who is usually described in the charge-

— 14 —

sheet as a medical student, so that he naturally has a somewhat 
family-physicianary way of putting things.

I agreed with George, and suggested that we should seek out 
some retired and old-world spot, far from the madding crowd, 
and dream away a sunny week among its drowsy lanes — some 
half-forgotten nook, hidden away by the fairies, out of reach 
of the noisy world — some quaint-perched eyrie on the cliffs 
of  Time,  from  whence  the  surging  waves  of  the  nineteenth 
century would sound far-off and faint.

Harris said he thought it would be humpy. He said he knew 
the sort of place I meant; where everybody went to bed at eight 
o’clock, and you couldn’t get a Referee for love or money, and 
had to walk ten miles to get your baccy.

“No,”  said  Harris, “if  you  want  rest  and  change,  you  can’t 

beat a sea trip.”

I objected to the sea trip strongly. A sea trip does you good 
when you are going to have a couple of months of it, but, for a 
week, it is wicked.

You start on Monday with the idea implanted in your bosom 
that you are going to enjoy yourself. You wave an airy adieu to 
the boys on shore, light your biggest pipe, and swagger about 
the deck as if you were Captain Cook, Sir Francis Drake, and 
Christopher  Columbus  all  rolled  into  one.  On  Tuesday,  you 
wish you hadn’t come. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, 
you  wish  you  were  dead.  On  Saturday,  you  are  able  to  swal-
low a little beef tea, and to sit up on deck, and answer with a 
wan, sweet smile when kind-hearted people ask you how you 
feel now. On Sunday, you begin to walk about again, and take 
solid  food. And  on  Monday  morning,  as,  with  your  bag  and 
umbrella in your hand, you stand by the gunwale, waiting to 
step ashore, you begin to thoroughly like it.

I  remember  my  brother-in-law  going  for  a  short  sea  trip 
once, for the benefit of his health. He took a return berth from 
London to Liverpool; and when he got to Liverpool, the only 
thing he was anxious about was to sell that return ticket.

It was offered round the town at a tremendous reduction, so 

— 15 —

I am told; and was eventually sold for eighteenpence to a bil-
ious-looking youth who had just been advised by his medical 
men to go to the sea-side, and take exercise.

“Sea-side!”  said  my  brother-in-law,  pressing  the  ticket  af-
fectionately into his hand; “why, you’ll have enough to last you 
a lifetime; and as for exercise! why, you’ll get more exercise, 
sitting down on that ship, than you would turning somersaults 
on dry land.”

He himself — my brother-in-law — came back by train. He 
said the North-Western Railway was healthy enough for him.
Another fellow I knew went for a week’s voyage round the 
coast, and, before they started, the steward came to him to ask 
whether he would pay for each meal as he had it, or arrange 
beforehand for the whole series.

The  steward  recommended  the  latter  course,  as  it  would 
come  so  much  cheaper.  He  said  they  would  do  him  for  the 
whole  week  at  two  pounds  five.  He  said  for  breakfast  there 
would be fish, followed by a grill. Lunch was at one, and con-
sisted of four courses. Dinner at six — soup, fish, entree, joint, 
poultry,  salad,  sweets,  cheese,  and  dessert.  And  a  light  meat 
supper at ten.

My  friend  thought  he  would  close  on  the  two-pound-five 

job (he is a hearty eater), and did so.

Lunch came just as they were off Sheerness. He didn’t feel 
so hungry as he thought he should, and so contented himself 
with a bit of boiled beef, and some strawberries and cream. He 
pondered a good deal during the afternoon, and at one time it 
seemed to him that he had been eating nothing but boiled beef 
for weeks, and at other times it seemed that he must have been 
living on strawberries and cream for years.

Neither  the  beef  nor  the  strawberries  and  cream  seemed 

happy, either — seemed discontented like.

At six, they came and told him dinner was ready. The an-
nouncement  aroused  no  enthusiasm  within  him,  but  he  felt 
that there was some of that two-pound-five to be worked off, 
and he held on to ropes and things and went down. A pleas-

— 16 —

ant odour of onions and hot ham, mingled with fried fish and 
greens, greeted him at the bottom of the ladder; and then the 
steward came up with an oily smile, and said:

“What can I get you, sir?”
“Get me out of this,” was the feeble reply.
And they ran him up quick, and propped him up, over to 

leeward, and left him.

For the next four days he lived a simple and blameless life 
on thin captain’s biscuits (I mean that the biscuits were thin, 
not the captain) and soda-water; but, towards Saturday, he got 
uppish, and went in for weak tea and dry toast, and on Mon-
day he was gorging himself on chicken broth. He left the ship 
on Tuesday, and as it steamed away from the landing-stage he 
gazed after it regretfully.

“There she goes,” he said, “there she goes, with two pounds’ 
worth of food on board that belongs to me, and that I haven’t 
had.”

He said that if they had given him another day he thought 

he could have put it straight.

So I set my face against the sea trip. Not, as I explained, upon 
my own account. I was never queer. But I was afraid for George. 
George said he should be all right, and would rather like it, but 
he would advise Harris and me not to think of it, as he felt sure 
we should both be ill. Harris said that, to himself, it was always 
a  mystery  how  people  managed  to  get  sick  at  sea — said  he 
thought people must do it on purpose, from affectation — said 
he had often wished to be, but had never been able.

Then he told us anecdotes of how he had gone across the 
Channel when it was so rough that the passengers had to be 
tied  into  their  berths,  and  he  and  the  captain  were  the  only 
two living souls on board who were not ill. Sometimes it was 
he and the second mate who were not ill; but it was generally 
he and one other man. If not he and another man, then it was 
he by himself.

It is a curious fact, but nobody ever is sea-sick — on land. At 
sea, you come across plenty of people very bad indeed, whole 

— 17 —

boat-loads of them; but I never met a man yet, on land, who 
had ever known at all what it was to be sea-sick. Where the 
thousands upon thousands of bad sailors that swarm in every 
ship hide themselves when they are on land is a mystery.

If most men were like a fellow I saw on the Yarmouth boat 
one day, I could account for the seeming enigma easily enough. 
It was just off Southend Pier, I recollect, and he was leaning out 
through one of the port-holes in a very dangerous position. I 
went up to him to try and save him.

“Hi! come further in,” I said, shaking him by the shoulder. 

“You’ll be overboard.”

there I had to leave him.

“Oh my! I wish I was,” was the only answer I could get; and 

Three  weeks  afterwards,  I  met  him  in  the  coffee-room  of 
a Bath hotel, talking about his voyages, and explaining, with 
enthusiasm, how he loved the sea.

“Good sailor!” he replied in answer to a mild young man’s 
envious query; “well, I did feel a little queer once, I confess. It 
was off Cape Horn. The vessel was wrecked the next morn-
ing.”

I said:
“Weren’t you a little shaky by Southend Pier one day, and 

wanted to be thrown overboard?”

“Southend Pier!” he replied, with a puzzled expression.
“Yes; going down to Yarmouth, last Friday three weeks.”
“Oh, ah — yes,” he answered, brightening up; “I remember 
now. I did have a headache that afternoon. It was the pickles, 
you know. They were the most disgraceful pickles I ever tasted 
in a respectable boat. Did you have any?”

For myself, I have discovered an excellent preventive against 
sea-sickness,  in  balancing  myself. You  stand  in  the  centre  of 
the deck, and, as the ship heaves and pitches, you move your 
body about, so as to keep it always straight. When the front of 
the ship rises, you lean forward, till the deck almost touches 
your nose; and when its back end gets up, you lean backwards. 

— 18 —

This is all very well for an hour or two; but you can’t balance 
yourself for a week.

George said:
“Let’s go up the river.”
He  said  we  should  have  fresh  air,  exercise  and  quiet;  the 
constant change of scene would occupy our minds (including 
what there was of Harris’s); and the hard work would give us a 
good appetite, and make us sleep well.

Harris said he didn’t think George ought to do anything that 
would have a tendency to make him sleepier than he always 
was, as it might be dangerous.

He said he didn’t very well understand how George was go-
ing to sleep any more than he did now, seeing that there were 
only twenty-four hours in each day, summer and winter alike; 
but thought that if he did sleep any more, he might just as well 
be dead, and so save his board and lodging.

Harris said, however, that the river would suit him to a “T.” 
I don’t know what a “T” is (except a sixpenny one, which in-
cludes bread-and-butter and cake ad lib., and is cheap at the 
price, if you haven’t had any dinner). It seems to suit every-
body, however, which is greatly to its credit.

It suited me to a “T” too, and Harris and I both said it was 
a good idea of George’s; and we said it in a tone that seemed 
to somehow imply that we were surprised that George should 
have come out so sensible.

The only one who was not struck with the suggestion was 
Montmorency. He never did care for the river, did Montmor-
ency.

“It’s all very well for you fellows,” he says; “you like it, but I 
don’t. There’s nothing for me to do. Scenery is not in my line, 
and I don’t smoke. If I see a rat, you won’t stop; and if I go to 
sleep, you get fooling about with the boat, and slop me over-
board. If you ask me, I call the whole thing bally foolishness.”
We were three to one, however, and the motion was carried.

— 19 —

CHAPTER II.

Plans  discussed. — Pleasures  of “camping-out,”  on  fine  nights. — 
Ditto, wet nights. — Compromise decided on. — Montmorency, first 
impressions of. — Fears lest he is too good for this world, fears sub-

sequently dismissed as groundless. — Meeting adjourns.

WE pulled out the maps, and discussed plans.

We arranged to start on the following Saturday from King-
ston. Harris and I would go down in the morning, and take 
the boat up to Chertsey, and George, who would not be able 
to get away from the City till the afternoon (George goes to 
sleep  at  a  bank  from  ten  to  four  each  day,  except  Saturdays, 
when they wake him up and put him outside at two), would 
meet us there.

Should we “camp out” or sleep at inns?
George and I were for camping out. We said it would be so 

wild and free, so patriarchal like.

Slowly the golden memory of the dead sun fades from the 
hearts of the cold, sad clouds. Silent, like sorrowing children, 
the birds have ceased their song, and only the moorhen’s plain-
tive cry and the harsh croak of the corncrake stirs the awed 
hush around the couch of waters, where the dying day breathes 
out her last.

From the dim woods on either bank, Night’s ghostly army, 
the grey shadows, creep out with noiseless tread to chase away 
the lingering rear-guard of the light, and pass, with noiseless, 
unseen  feet,  above  the  waving  river-grass,  and  through  the 
sighing rushes; and Night, upon her sombre throne, folds her 
black wings above the darkening world, and, from her phan-
tom palace, lit by the pale stars, reigns in stillness.

Then we run our little boat into some quiet nook, and the 
tent is pitched, and the frugal supper cooked and eaten. Then 
the big pipes are filled and lighted, and the pleasant chat goes 
round in musical undertone; while, in the pauses of our talk, 
the river, playing round the boat, prattles strange old tales and 
secrets, sings low the old child’s song that it has sung so many 

— 20 —

thousand years — will sing so many thousand years to come, 
before  its  voice  grows  harsh  and  old — a  song  that  we,  who 
have learnt to love its changing face, who have so often nestled 
on its yielding bosom, think, somehow, we understand, though 
we could not tell you in mere words the story that we listen 
to.

And we sit there, by its margin, while the moon, who loves 
it  too,  stoops  down  to  kiss  it  with  a  sister’s  kiss,  and  throws 
her  silver  arms  around  it  clingingly;  and  we  watch  it  as  it 
flows,  ever  singing,  ever  whispering,  out  to  meet  its  king, 
the sea — till our voices die away in silence, and the pipes go 
out — till we, common-place, everyday young men enough, feel 
strangely full of thoughts, half sad, half sweet, and do not care 
or want to speak — till we laugh, and, rising, knock the ashes 
from  our  burnt-out  pipes,  and  say “Good-night,”  and,  lulled 
by the lapping water and the rustling trees, we fall asleep be-
neath the great, still stars, and dream that the world is young 
again — young and sweet as she used to be ere the centuries of 
fret and care had furrowed her fair face, ere her children’s sins 
and follies had made old her loving heart — sweet as she was 
in those bygone days when, a new-made mother, she nursed 
us, her children, upon her own deep breast — ere the wiles of 
painted civilization had lured us away from her fond arms, and 
the poisoned sneers of artificiality had made us ashamed of 
the simple life we led with her, and the simple, stately home 
where mankind was born so many thousands years ago.

Harris said:
“How about when it rained?”
You  can  never  rouse  Harris.  There  is  no  poetry  about 
Harris — no wild yearning for the unattainable. Harris never 
“weeps, he knows not why.” If Harris’s eyes fill with tears, you 
can bet it is because Harris has been eating raw onions, or has 
put too much Worcester over his chop.

If you were to stand at night by the sea-shore with Harris, 

and say:

“Hark!  do  you  not  hear?  Is  it  but  the  mermaids  singing 

— 21 —

deep below the waving waters; or sad spirits, chanting dirges 
for white corpses, held by seaweed?” Harris would take you by 
the arm, and say:

“I  know  what  it  is,  old  man;  you’ve  got  a  chill.  Now,  you 
come  along  with  me.  I  know  a  place  round  the  corner  here, 
where you can get a drop of the finest Scotch whisky you ever 
tasted — put you right in less than no time.”

Harris  always  does  know  a  place  round  the  corner  where 
you can get something brilliant in the drinking line. I believe 
that if you met Harris up in Paradise (supposing such a thing 
likely), he would immediately greet you with:

“So  glad  you’ve  come,  old  fellow;  I’ve  found  a  nice  place 
round  the  corner  here,  where  you  can  get  some  really  first-
class nectar.”

In the present instance, however, as regarded the camping 
out, his practical view of the matter came as a very timely hint. 
Camping out in rainy weather is not pleasant.

It is evening. You are wet through, and there is a good two 
inches of water in the boat, and all the things are damp. You 
find a place on the banks that is not quite so puddly as other 
places you have seen, and you land and lug out the tent, and 
two of you proceed to fix it.

It is soaked and heavy, and it flops about, and tumbles down 
on you, and clings round your head and makes you mad. The 
rain is pouring steadily down all the time. It is difficult enough 
to fix a tent in dry weather: in wet, the task becomes herculean. 
Instead of helping you, it seems to you that the other man is 
simply playing the fool. Just as you get your side beautifully 
fixed, he gives it a hoist from his end, and spoils it all.

“Here! what are you up to?” you call out.
“What are you up to?” he retorts; “leggo, can’t you?”
“Don’t pull it; you’ve got it all wrong, you stupid ass!” you 

shout.

“No, I haven’t,” he yells back; “let go your side!”
“I tell you you’ve got it all wrong!” you roar, wishing that 

— 22 —

you could get at him; and you give your ropes a lug that pulls 
all his pegs out.

“Ah, the bally idiot!” you hear him mutter to himself; and 
then  comes  a  savage  haul,  and  away  goes  your  side. You  lay 
down the mallet and start to go round and tell him what you 
think about the whole business, and, at the same time, he starts 
round in the same direction to come and explain his views to 
you. And you follow each other round and round, swearing at 
one another, until the tent tumbles down in a heap, and leaves 
you looking at each other across its ruins, when you both in-
dignantly exclaim, in the same breath:
“There you are! what did I tell you?”
Meanwhile the third man, who has been baling out the boat, 
and who has spilled the water down his sleeve, and has been 
cursing away to himself steadily for the last ten minutes, wants 
to know what the thundering blazes you’re playing at, and why 
the blarmed tent isn’t up yet.

At last, somehow or other, it does get up, and you land the 
things. It is hopeless attempting to make a wood fire, so you 
light the methylated spirit stove, and crowd round that.

Rainwater is the chief article of diet at supper. The bread is 
two-thirds rainwater, the beefsteak-pie is exceedingly rich in 
it, and the jam, and the butter, and the salt, and the coffee have 
all combined with it to make soup.

After supper, you find your tobacco is damp, and you cannot 
smoke. Luckily you have a bottle of the stuff that cheers and 
inebriates, if taken in proper quantity, and this restores to you 
sufficient interest in life to induce you to go to bed.

There you dream that an elephant has suddenly sat down 
on your chest, and that the volcano has exploded and thrown 
you down to the bottom of the sea — the elephant still sleeping 
peacefully on your bosom. You wake up and grasp the idea that 
something terrible really has happened. Your first impression 
is that the end of the world has come; and then you think that 
this cannot be, and that it is thieves and murderers, or else fire, 
and  this  opinion  you  express  in  the  usual  method.  No  help 

— 23 —

comes, however, and all you know is that thousands of people 
are kicking you, and you are being smothered.

Somebody else seems in trouble, too. You can hear his faint 
cries coming from underneath your bed. Determining, at all 
events, to sell your life dearly, you struggle frantically, hitting 
out  right  and  left  with  arms  and  legs,  and  yelling  lustily  the 
while, and at last something gives way, and you find your head 
in the fresh air. Two feet off, you dimly observe a half-dressed 
ruffian, waiting to kill you, and you are preparing for a life-
and-death  struggle  with  him,  when  it  begins  to  dawn  upon 
you that it’s Jim.

“Oh,  it’s  you,  is  it?”  he  says,  recognising  you  at  the  same 

moment.

“Yes,” you answer, rubbing your eyes; “what’s happened?”
“Bally tent’s blown down, I think,” he says.
“Where’s Bill?”
Then you both raise up your voices and shout for “Bill!” and 
the  ground  beneath  you  heaves  and  rocks,  and  the  muffled 
voice that you heard before replies from out the ruin:

“Get off my head, can’t you?”
And Bill struggles out, a muddy, trampled wreck, and in an 
unnecessarily aggressive mood — he being under the evident 
belief that the whole thing has been done on purpose.

In the morning you are all three speechless, owing to having 
caught  severe  colds  in  the  night;  you  also  feel  very  quarrel-
some, and you swear at each other in hoarse whispers during 
the whole of breakfast time.

We therefore decided that we would sleep out on fine nights; 
and hotel it, and inn it, and pub. it, like respectable folks, when 
it was wet, or when we felt inclined for a change.

Montmorency  hailed  this  compromise  with  much  ap-
proval.  He  does  not  revel  in  romantic  solitude.  Give  him 
something  noisy;  and  if  a  trifle  low,  so  much  the  jollier.  To 
look  at  Montmorency  you  would  imagine  that  he  was  an 
angel  sent  upon  the  earth,  for  some  reason  withheld  from 
mankind,  in  the  shape  of  a  small  fox-terrier.  There  is  a  sort 

— 24 —

of Oh-what-a-wicked-world-this-is-and-how-I-wish-I-could-
do-something-to-make-it-better-and-nobler expression about 
Montmorency that has been known to bring the tears into the 
eyes of pious old ladies and gentlemen.

When first he came to live at my expense, I never thought I 
should be able to get him to stop long. I used to sit down and 
look  at  him,  as  he  sat  on  the  rug  and  looked  up  at  me,  and 
think: “Oh, that dog will never live. He will be snatched up to 
the bright skies in a chariot, that is what will happen to him.”

But,  when  I  had  paid  for  about  a  dozen  chickens  that  he 
had killed; and had dragged him, growling and kicking, by the 
scruff of his neck, out of a hundred and fourteen street fights; 
and had had a dead cat brought round for my inspection by an 
irate female, who called me a murderer; and had been sum-
moned by the man next door but one for having a ferocious 
dog at large, that had kept him pinned up in his own tool-shed, 
afraid to venture his nose outside the door for over two hours 
on a cold night; and had learned that the gardener, unknown 
to myself, had won thirty shillings by backing him to kill rats 
against time, then I began to think that maybe they’d let him 
remain on earth for a bit longer, after all.

To hang about a stable, and collect a gang of the most dis-
reputable dogs to be found in the town, and lead them out to 
march  round  the  slums  to  fight  other  disreputable  dogs,  is 
Montmorency’s idea of “life;” and so, as I before observed, he 
gave to the suggestion of inns, and pubs., and hotels his most 
emphatic approbation.

Having thus settled the sleeping arrangements to the satis-
faction of all four of us, the only thing left to discuss was what 
we should take with us; and this we had begun to argue, when 
Harris said he’d had enough oratory for one night, and pro-
posed that we should go out and have a smile, saying that he 
had found a place, round by the square, where you could really 
get a drop of Irish worth drinking.

George said he felt thirsty (I never knew George when he 
didn’t); and, as I had a presentiment that a little whisky, warm, 

— 25 —

with a slice of lemon, would do my complaint good, the debate 
was, by common assent, adjourned to the following night; and 
the assembly put on its hats and went out.

— 26 —

CHAPTER III.

Arrangements settled. — Harris’s method of doing work. — How the 
elderly family-man puts up a picture. — George makes a sensible, 
remark. — Delights of early morning bathing. — Provisions for get-

ting upset.

SO, on the following evening, we again assembled, to discuss 
and arrange our plans. Harris said:

“Now, the first thing to settle is what to take with us. Now, 
you get a bit of paper and write down, J., and you get the gro-
cery catalogue, George, and somebody give me a bit of pencil, 
and then I’ll make out a list.”

That’s Harris all over — so ready to take the burden of every-

thing himself, and put it on the backs of other people.

He always reminds me of my poor Uncle Podger. You never 
saw such a commotion up and down a house, in all your life, as 
when my Uncle Podger undertook to do a job. A picture would 
have come home from the frame-maker’s, and be standing in 
the dining-room, waiting to be put up; and Aunt Podger would 
ask what was to be done with it, and Uncle Podger would say:
“Oh,  you  leave  that  to  me.  Don’t  you,  any  of  you,  worry 

yourselves about that. I’ll do all that.”

And then he would take off his coat, and begin. He would 
send the girl out for sixpen’orth of nails, and then one of the 
boys after her to tell her what size to get; and, from that, he 
would gradually work down, and start the whole house.

“Now you go and get me my hammer, Will,” he would shout; 
“and you bring me the rule, Tom; and I shall want the step-lad-
der, and I had better have a kitchen-chair, too; and, Jim! you 
run round to Mr. Goggles, and tell him, ‘Pa’s kind regards, and 
hopes  his  leg’s  better;  and  will  he  lend  him  his  spirit-level?’ 
And  don’t  you  go,  Maria,  because  I  shall  want  somebody  to 
hold  me  the  light;  and  when  the  girl  comes  back,  she  must 
go  out  again  for  a  bit  of  picture-cord;  and  Tom! — where’s 
Tom? — Tom, you come here; I shall want you to hand me up 
the picture.”

— 27 —

And then he would lift up the picture, and drop it, and it 
would come out of the frame, and he would try to save the glass, 
and cut himself; and then he would spring round the room, 
looking for his handkerchief. He could not find his handker-
chief, because it was in the pocket of the coat he had taken off, 
and he did not know where he had put the coat, and all the 
house had to leave off looking for his tools, and start looking 
for  his  coat;  while  he  would  dance  round  and  hinder  them.
“Doesn’t anybody in the whole house know where my coat 
is?  I  never  came  across  such  a  set  in  all  my  life — upon  my 
word I didn’t. Six of you! — and you can’t find a coat that I put 
down not five minutes ago! Well, of all the —”

Then he’d get up, and find that he had been sitting on it, and 

would call out:

“Oh, you can give it up! I’ve found it myself now. Might just 
as  well  ask  the  cat  to  find  anything  as  expect  you  people  to 
find it.”

And, when half an hour had been spent in tying up his fin-
ger, and a new glass had been got, and the tools, and the ladder, 
and the chair, and the candle had been brought, he would have 
another go, the whole family, including the girl and the char-
woman,  standing  round  in  a  semi-circle,  ready  to  help.  Two 
people would have to hold the chair, and a third would help 
him up on it, and hold him there, and a fourth would hand 
him a nail, and a fifth would pass him up the hammer, and he 
would take hold of the nail, and drop it.

“There!” he would say, in an injured tone, “now the nail’s 

gone.”

And we would all have to go down on our knees and grovel 
for it, while he would stand on the chair, and grunt, and want 
to know if he was to be kept there all the evening.

The nail would be found at last, but by that time he would 

have lost the hammer.

“Where’s  the  hammer? What  did  I  do  with  the  hammer? 
Great  heavens!  Seven  of  you,  gaping  round  there,  and  you 
don’t know what I did with the hammer!”

— 28 —

We would find the hammer for him, and then he would have 
lost sight of the mark he had made on the wall, where the nail 
was to go in, and each of us had to get up on the chair, beside 
him, and see if we could find it; and we would each discover 
it in a different place, and he would call us all fools, one after 
another, and tell us to get down. And he would take the rule, 
and re-measure, and find that he wanted half thirty-one and 
three-eighths inches from the corner, and would try to do it in 
his head, and go mad.

And we would all try to do it in our heads, and all arrive 
at different results, and sneer at one another. And in the gen-
eral row, the original number would be forgotten, and Uncle 
Podger would have to measure it again.

He would use a bit of string this time, and at the critical mo-
ment, when the old fool was leaning over the chair at an angle 
of forty-five, and trying to reach a point three inches beyond 
what was possible for him to reach, the string would slip, and 
down he would slide on to the piano, a really fine musical ef-
fect being produced by the suddenness with which his head 
and body struck all the notes at the same time.

And Aunt  Maria  would  say  that  she  would  not  allow  the 

children to stand round and hear such language.

At  last,  Uncle  Podger  would  get  the  spot  fixed  again,  and 
put the point of the nail on it with his left hand, and take the 
hammer in his right hand. And, with the first blow, he would 
smash his thumb, and drop the hammer, with a yell, on some-
body’s toes.

Aunt  Maria  would  mildly  observe  that,  next  time  Uncle 
Podger was going to hammer a nail into the wall, she hoped 
he’d let her know in time, so that she could make arrangements 
to go and spend a week with her mother while it was being 
done.

“Oh! you women, you make such a fuss over everything,” 
Uncle Podger would reply, picking himself up. “Why, I like do-
ing a little job of this sort.”

And  then  he  would  have  another  try,  and,  at  the  second 

— 29 —

blow, the nail would go clean through the plaster, and half the 
hammer after it, and Uncle Podger be precipitated against the 
wall with force nearly sufficient to flatten his nose.

Then  we  had  to  find  the  rule  and  the  string  again,  and  a 
new hole was made; and, about midnight, the picture would 
be up — very crooked and insecure, the wall for yards round 
looking as if it had been smoothed down with a rake, and eve-
rybody dead beat and wretched — except Uncle Podger.

“There you are,” he would say, stepping heavily off the chair 
on to the charwoman’s corns, and surveying the mess he had 
made with evident pride. “Why, some people would have had a 
man in to do a little thing like that!”

Harris  will  be  just  that  sort  of  man  when  he  grows  up,  I 
know, and I told him so. I said I could not permit him to take 
so much labour upon himself. I said:

“No; you get the paper, and the pencil, and the catalogue, 

and George write down, and I’ll do the work.”

The first list we made out had to be discarded. It was clear 
that the upper reaches of the Thames would not allow of the 
navigation of a boat sufficiently large to take the things we had 
set down as indispensable; so we tore the list up, and looked 
at one another!
George said:
“You know we are on a wrong track altogether. We must not 
think of the things we could do with, but only of the things 
that we can’t do without.”

George  comes  out  really  quite  sensible  at  times. You’d  be 
surprised. I call that downright wisdom, not merely as regards 
the present case, but with reference to our trip up the river of 
life, generally. How many people, on that voyage, load up the 
boat till it is ever in danger of swamping with a store of foolish 
things which they think essential to the pleasure and comfort 
of the trip, but which are really only useless lumber.

How  they  pile  the  poor  little  craft  mast-high  with  fine 
clothes  and  big  houses;  with  useless  servants,  and  a  host  of 
swell  friends  that  do  not  care  twopence  for  them,  and  that 

— 30 —

they do not care three ha’pence for; with expensive entertain-
ments that nobody enjoys, with formalities and fashions, with 
pretence  and  ostentation,  and  with — oh,  heaviest,  maddest 
lumber of all! — the dread of what will my neighbour think, 
with  luxuries  that  only  cloy,  with  pleasures  that  bore,  with 
empty show that, like the criminal’s iron crown of yore, makes 
to bleed and swoon the aching head that wears it!

It is lumber, man — all lumber! Throw it overboard. It makes 
the boat so heavy to pull, you nearly faint at the oars. It makes 
it so cumbersome and dangerous to manage, you never know 
a moment’s freedom from anxiety and care, never gain a mo-
ment’s rest for dreamy laziness — no time to watch the windy 
shadows skimming lightly o’er the shallows, or the glittering 
sunbeams flitting in and out among the ripples, or the great 
trees by the margin looking down at their own image, or the 
woods all green and golden, or the lilies white and yellow, or 
the sombre-waving rushes, or the sedges, or the orchis, or the 
blue forget-me-nots.

Throw the lumber over, man! Let your boat of life be light, 
packed with only what you need — a homely home and sim-
ple  pleasures,  one  or  two  friends,  worth  the  name,  someone 
to love and someone to love you, a cat, a dog, and a pipe or 
two, enough to eat and enough to wear, and a little more than 
enough to drink; for thirst is a dangerous thing.

You will find the boat easier to pull then, and it will not be so 
liable to upset, and it will not matter so much if it does upset; 
good, plain merchandise will stand water. You will have time to 
think as well as to work. Time to drink in life’s sunshine — time 
to listen to the Æolian music that the wind of God draws from 
the human heart-strings around us — time to —

I beg your pardon, really. I quite forgot.
Well, we left the list to George, and he began it.
“We won’t take a tent,” suggested George; “we will have a 
boat with a cover. It is ever so much simpler, and more com-
fortable.”

It seemed a good thought, and we adopted it. I do not know 

— 31 —

whether  you  have  ever  seen  the  thing  I  mean. You  fix  iron 
hoops up over the boat, and stretch a huge canvas over them, 
and fasten it down all round, from stem to stern, and it con-
verts the boat into a sort of little house, and it is beautifully 
cosy, though a trifle stuffy; but there, everything has its draw-
backs, as the man said when his mother-in-law died, and they 
came down upon him for the funeral expenses.

George  said  that  in  that  case  we  must  take  a  rug  each,  a 
lamp,  some  soap,  a  brush  and  comb  (between  us),  a  tooth-
brush (each), a basin, some tooth-powder, some shaving tackle 
(sounds like a French exercise, doesn’t it?), and a couple of big-
towels for bathing. I notice that people always make gigantic 
arrangements for bathing when they are going anywhere near 
the water, but that they don’t bathe much when they are there.
It is the same when you go to the sea-side. I always deter-
mine — when  thinking  over  the  matter  in  London — that  I’ll 
get  up  early  every  morning,  and  go  and  have  a  dip  before 
breakfast,  and  I  religiously  pack  up  a  pair  of  drawers  and  a 
bath  towel.  I  always  get  red  bathing  drawers.  I  rather  fancy 
myself in red drawers. They suit my complexion so. But when I 
get to the sea I don’t feel somehow that I want that early morn-
ing bathe nearly so much as I did when I was in town.

On the contrary, I feel more that I want to stop in bed till 
the last moment, and then come down and have my breakfast. 
Once or twice virtue has triumphed, and I have got out at six 
and half-dressed myself, and have taken my drawers and towel, 
and stumbled dismally off. But I haven’t enjoyed it. They seem 
to keep a specially cutting east wind, waiting for me, when I go 
to bathe in the early morning; and they pick out all the three-
cornered stones, and put them on the top, and they sharpen up 
the rocks and cover the points over with a bit of sand so that I 
can’t see them, and they take the sea and put it two miles out, 
so that I have to huddle myself up in my arms and hop, shiver-
ing, through six inches of water. And when I do get to the sea, 
it is rough and quite insulting.

One huge wave catches me up and chucks me in a sitting 

— 32 —

posture, as hard as ever it can, down on to a rock which has 
been put there for me. And, before I’ve said “Oh! Ugh!” and 
found out what has gone, the wave comes back and carries me 
out to mid-ocean. I begin to strike out frantically for the shore, 
and  wonder  if  I  shall  ever  see  home  and  friends  again,  and 
wish I’d been kinder to my little sister when a boy (when I was 
a boy, I mean). Just when I have given up all hope, a wave re-
tires and leaves me sprawling like a star-fish on the sand, and I 
get up and look back and find that I’ve been swimming for my 
life in two feet of water. I hop back and dress, and crawl home, 
where I have to pretend I liked it.

In the present instance, we all talked as if we were going to 

have a long swim every morning.

George said it was so pleasant to wake up in the boat in the 
fresh  morning,  and  plunge  into  the  limpid  river.  Harris  said 
there  was  nothing  like  a  swim  before  breakfast  to  give  you 
an  appetite.  He  said  it  always  gave  him  an  appetite.  George 
said that if it was going to make Harris eat more than Harris 
ordinarily ate, then he should protest against Harris having a 
bath at all.

He said there would be quite enough hard work in towing 

sufficient food for Harris up against stream, as it was.

I  urged  upon  George,  however,  how  much  pleasanter  it 
would be to have Harris clean and fresh about the boat, even if 
we did have to take a few more hundredweight of provisions; 
and he got to see it in my light, and withdrew his opposition 
to Harris’s bath.

Agreed, finally, that we should take three bath towels, so as 

not to keep each other waiting.

For clothes, George said two suits of flannel would be suffi-
cient, as we could wash them ourselves, in the river, when they 
got dirty. We asked him if he had ever tried washing flannels 
in the river, and he replied: “No, not exactly himself like; but 
he knew some fellows who had, and it was easy enough;” and 
Harris and I were weak enough to fancy he knew what he was 
talking about, and that three respectable young men, without 

— 33 —

position  or  influence,  and  with  no  experience  in  washing, 
could  really  clean  their  own  shirts  and  trousers  in  the  river 
Thames with a bit of soap.

We were to learn in the days to come, when it was too late, 
that  George  was  a  miserable  impostor,  who  could  evidently 
have  known  nothing  whatever  about  the  matter.  If  you  had 
seen these clothes after — but, as the shilling shockers say, we 
anticipate.

George impressed upon us to take a change of under-things 
and plenty of socks, in case we got upset and wanted a change; 
also plenty of handkerchiefs, as they would do to wipe things, 
and a pair of leather boots as well as our boating shoes, as we 
should want them if we got upset.

CHAPTER IV.

The  food  question. — Objections  to  paraffine  oil  as  an  atmos-
phere. — Advantages of cheese as a travelling companion. — A mar-
ried woman deserts her home. — Further provision for getting up-
set. — I pack. — Cussedness of tooth-brushes. — George and Harris 

pack. — Awful behaviour of Montmorency. — We retire to rest.

THEN we discussed the food question. George said:

“Begin  with  breakfast.”  (George  is  so  practical.) “Now  for 
breakfast  we  shall  want  a  frying-pan” — (Harris  said  it  was 
indigestible;  but  we  merely  urged  him  not  to  be  an  ass,  and 
George went on) — “a tea-pot and a kettle, and a methylated 
spirit stove.”

“No  oil,”  said  George,  with  a  significant  look;  and  Harris 

and I agreed.

We had taken up an oil-stove once, but “never again.” It had 
been like living in an oil-shop that week. It oozed. I never saw 
such a thing as paraffine oil is to ooze. We kept it in the nose 
of the boat, and, from there, it oozed down to the rudder, im-
pregnating the whole boat and everything in it on its way, and 
it oozed over the river, and saturated the scenery and spoilt the 
atmosphere. Sometimes a westerly oily wind blew, and at other 
times an easterly oily wind, and sometimes it blew a northerly 
oily  wind,  and  maybe  a  southerly  oily  wind;  but  whether  it 
came from the Arctic snows, or was raised in the waste of the 
desert sands, it came alike to us laden with the fragrance of 
paraffine oil.

And that oil oozed up and ruined the sunset; and as for the 

moonbeams, they positively reeked of paraffine.

We  tried  to  get  away  from  it  at  Marlow. We  left  the  boat 
by the bridge, and took a walk through the town to escape it, 
but it followed us. The whole town was full of oil. We passed 
through the church-yard, and it seemed as if the people had 
been buried in oil. The High Street stunk of oil; we wondered 
how people could live in it. And we walked miles upon miles 
out  Birmingham  way;  but  it  was  no  use,  the  country  was 
steeped in oil.

— 35 —

At  the  end  of  that  trip  we  met  together  at  midnight  in  a 
lonely field, under a blasted oak, and took an awful oath (we 
had been swearing for a whole week about the thing in an or-
dinary, middle-class way, but this was a swell affair) — an awful 
oath never to take paraffine oil with us in a boat again — ex-
cept, of course, in case of sickness.

Therefore, in the present instance, we confined ourselves to 
methylated  spirit.  Even  that  is  bad  enough. You  get  methyl-
ated  pie  and  methylated  cake.  But  methylated  spirit  is  more 
wholesome  when  taken  into  the  system  in  large  quantities 
than paraffine oil.

For other breakfast things, George suggested eggs and ba-
con, which were easy to cook, cold meat, tea, bread and butter, 
and jam. For lunch, he said, we could have biscuits, cold meat, 
bread  and  butter,  and  jam — but  no  cheese.  Cheese,  like  oil, 
makes too much of itself. It wants the whole boat to itself. It 
goes through the hamper, and gives a cheesy flavour to every-
thing else there. You can’t tell whether you are eating apple-pie 
or  German  sausage,  or  strawberries  and  cream.  It  all  seems 
cheese. There is too much odour about cheese.

I remember a friend of mine, buying a couple of cheeses at 
Liverpool. Splendid cheeses they were, ripe and mellow, and 
with a two hundred horse-power scent about them that might 
have been warranted to carry three miles, and knock a man 
over at two hundred yards. I was in Liverpool at the time, and 
my friend said that if I didn’t mind he would get me to take 
them  back  with  me  to  London,  as  he  should  not  be  coming 
up for a day or two himself, and he did not think the cheeses 
ought to be kept much longer.

“Oh, with pleasure, dear boy,” I replied, “with pleasure.”
I called for the cheeses, and took them away in a cab. It was 
a ramshackle affair, dragged along by a knock-kneed, broken-
winded somnambulist, which his owner, in a moment of en-
thusiasm, during conversation, referred to as a horse. I put the 
cheeses on the top, and we started off at a shamble that would 
have done credit to the swiftest steam-roller ever built, and all 

— 36 —

went merry as a funeral bell, until we turned the corner. There, 
the wind carried a whiff from the cheeses full on to our steed. 
It woke him up, and, with a snort of terror, he dashed off at 
three miles an hour. The wind still blew in his direction, and 
before we reached the end of the street he was laying himself 
out at the rate of nearly four miles an hour, leaving the cripples 
and stout old ladies simply nowhere.

It took two porters as well as the driver to hold him in at 
the station; and I do not think they would have done it, even 
then, had not one of the men had the presence of mind to put a 
handkerchief over his nose, and to light a bit of brown paper.

I took my ticket, and marched proudly up the platform, with 
my cheeses, the people falling back respectfully on either side. 
The train was crowded, and I had to get into a carriage where 
there were already seven other people. One crusty old gentle-
man objected, but I got in, notwithstanding; and, putting my 
cheeses upon the rack, squeezed down with a pleasant smile, 
and said it was a warm day.

A few moments passed, and then the old gentleman began 

to fidget.

“Very close in here,” he said.
“Quite oppressive,” said the man next him.
And then they both began sniffing, and, at the third sniff, 
they caught it right on the chest, and rose up without another 
word and went out. And then a stout lady got up, and said it 
was disgraceful that a respectable married woman should be 
harried  about  in  this  way,  and  gathered  up  a  bag  and  eight 
parcels and went. The remaining four passengers sat on for a 
while, until a solemn-looking man in the corner, who, from his 
dress and general appearance, seemed to belong to the under-
taker class, said it put him in mind of dead baby; and the other 
three passengers tried to get out of the door at the same time, 
and hurt themselves.

I  smiled  at  the  black  gentleman,  and  said  I  thought  we 
were going to have the carriage to ourselves; and he laughed 
pleasantly, and said that some people made such a fuss over a 

— 37 —

little thing. But even he grew strangely depressed after we had 
started, and so, when we reached Crewe, I asked him to come 
and have a drink. He accepted, and we forced our way into the 
buffet, where we yelled, and stamped, and waved our umbrel-
las for a quarter of an hour; and then a young lady came, and 
asked us if we wanted anything.

“What’s yours?” I said, turning to my friend.
“I’ll have half-a-crown’s worth of brandy, neat, if you please, 

miss,” he responded.

And he went off quietly after he had drunk it and got into 

another carriage, which I thought mean.

From Crewe I had the compartment to myself, though the 
train was crowded. As we drew up at the different stations, the 
people, seeing my empty carriage, would rush for it. “Here y’ 
are, Maria; come along, plenty of room.” “All right, Tom; we’ll 
get in here,” they would shout. And they would run along, car-
rying heavy bags, and fight round the door to get in first. And 
one  would  open  the  door  and  mount  the  steps,  and  stagger 
back into the arms of the man behind him; and they would 
all come and have a sniff, and then droop off and squeeze into 
other carriages, or pay the difference and go first.

From Euston, I took the cheeses down to my friend’s house. 
When his wife came into the room she smelt round for an in-
stant. Then she said:

“What is it? Tell me the worst.”
I said:
“It’s cheeses. Tom bought them in Liverpool, and asked me 

to bring them up with me.”

And I added that I hoped she understood that it had noth-
ing to do with me; and she said that she was sure of that, but 
that she would speak to Tom about it when he came back.

My friend was detained in Liverpool longer than he expect-
ed; and, three days later, as he hadn’t returned home, his wife 
called on me. She said:

“What did Tom say about those cheeses?”

— 38 —

I replied that he had directed they were to be kept in a moist 

place, and that nobody was to touch them.

She said:
“Nobody’s likely to touch them. Had he smelt them?”
I thought he had, and added that he seemed greatly attached 

to them.

“You think he would be upset,” she queried, “if I gave a man 

a sovereign to take them away and bury them?”

I answered that I thought he would never smile again.
An idea struck her. She said:
“Do  you  mind  keeping  them  for  him?  Let  me  send  them 

round to you.”

“Madam,”  I  replied, “for  myself  I  like  the  smell  of  cheese, 
and the journey the other day with them from Liverpool I shall 
ever look back upon as a happy ending to a pleasant holiday. 
But,  in  this  world,  we  must  consider  others.  The  lady  under 
whose roof I have the honour of residing is a widow, and, for 
all I know, possibly an orphan too. She has a strong, I may say 
an eloquent, objection to being what she terms ‘put upon.’ The 
presence of your husband’s cheeses in her house she would, I 
instinctively feel, regard as a ‘put upon’; and it shall never be 
said that I put upon the widow and the orphan.”

“Very well, then,” said my friend’s wife, rising, “all I have to 
say is, that I shall take the children and go to an hotel until 
those cheeses are eaten. I decline to live any longer in the same 
house with them.”

She kept her word, leaving the place in charge of the char-
woman, who, when asked if she could stand the smell, replied, 
“What smell?” and who, when taken close to the cheeses and 
told to sniff hard, said she could detect a faint odour of mel-
ons. It was argued from this that little injury could result to the 
woman from the atmosphere, and she was left.

The hotel bill came to fifteen guineas; and my friend, after 
reckoning everything up, found that the cheeses had cost him 
eight-and-sixpence a pound. He said he dearly loved a bit of 
cheese, but it was beyond his means; so he determined to get 

— 39 —

rid of them. He threw them into the canal; but had to fish them 
out  again,  as  the  bargemen  complained.  They  said  it  made 
them feel quite faint. And, after that, he took them one dark 
night and left them in the parish mortuary. But the coroner 
discovered them, and made a fearful fuss.

He said it was a plot to deprive him of his living by waking 

up the corpses.

My friend got rid of them, at last, by taking them down to 
a sea-side town, and burying them on the beach. It gained the 
place quite a reputation. Visitors said they had never noticed 
before  how  strong  the  air  was,  and  weak-chested  and  con-
sumptive people used to throng there for years afterwards.

Fond as I am of cheese, therefore, I hold that George was 

right in declining to take any.

“We shan’t want any tea,” said George (Harris’s face fell at 
this); “but  we’ll  have  a  good  round,  square,  slap-up  meal  at 
seven — dinner, tea, and supper combined.”

Harris grew more cheerful. George suggested meat and fruit 
pies, cold meat, tomatoes, fruit, and green stuff. For drink, we 
took some wonderful sticky concoction of Harris’s, which you 
mixed  with  water  and  called  lemonade,  plenty  of  tea,  and  a 
bottle of whisky, in case, as George said, we got upset.

It seemed to me that George harped too much on the get-
ting-upset idea. It seemed to me the wrong spirit to go about 
the trip in.

But I’m glad we took the whisky.
We didn’t take beer or wine. They are a mistake up the river. 
They make you feel sleepy and heavy. A glass in the evening 
when you are doing a mouch round the town and looking at 
the girls is all right enough; but don’t drink when the sun is 
blazing down on your head, and you’ve got hard work to do.

We made a list of the things to be taken, and a pretty lengthy 
one it was, before we parted that evening. The next day, which 
was Friday, we got them all together, and met in the evening to 
pack. We got a big Gladstone for the clothes, and a couple of 
hampers for the victuals and the cooking utensils. We moved 

— 40 —

the table up against the window, piled everything in a heap in 
the middle of the floor, and sat round and looked at it.

I said I’d pack.
I rather pride myself on my packing. Packing is one of those 
many  things  that  I  feel  I  know  more  about  than  any  other 
person living. (It surprises me myself, sometimes, how many 
of these subjects there are.) I impressed the fact upon George 
and Harris, and told them that they had better leave the whole 
matter  entirely  to  me.  They  fell  into  the  suggestion  with  a 
readiness  that  had  something  uncanny  about  it.  George  put 
on a pipe and spread himself over the easy-chair, and Harris 
cocked his legs on the table and lit a cigar.

This  was  hardly  what  I  intended.  What  I  had  meant,  of 
course,  was,  that  I  should  boss  the  job,  and  that  Harris  and 
George  should  potter  about  under  my  directions,  I  pushing 
them aside every now and then with, “Oh, you — !” “Here, let 
me do it.” “There you are, simple enough!” — really teaching 
them, as you might say. Their taking it in the way they did ir-
ritated me. There is nothing does irritate me more than seeing 
other people sitting about doing nothing when I’m working.

I  lived  with  a  man  once  who  used  to  make  me  mad  that 
way. He would loll on the sofa and watch me doing things by 
the hour together, following me round the room with his eyes, 
wherever I went. He said it did him real good to look on at me, 
messing about. He said it made him feel that life was not an 
idle dream to be gaped and yawned through, but a noble task, 
full of duty and stern work. He said he often wondered now 
how he could have gone on before he met me, never having 
anybody to look at while they worked.

Now, I’m not like that. I can’t sit still and see another man 
slaving  and  working.  I  want  to  get  up  and  superintend,  and 
walk round with my hands in my pockets, and tell him what to 
do. It is my energetic nature. I can’t help it.

However, I did not say anything, but started the packing. It 
seemed a longer job than I had thought it was going to be; but 
I got the bag finished at last, and I sat on it and strapped it.

— 41 —

“Ain’t you going to put the boots in?” said Harris.
And I looked round, and found I had forgotten them. That’s 
just like Harris. He couldn’t have said a word until I’d got the 
bag shut and strapped, of course. And George laughed — one of 
those irritating, senseless, chuckle-headed, crack-jawed laughs 
of his. They do make me so wild.

I opened the bag and packed the boots in; and then, just as 
I was going to close it, a horrible idea occurred to me. Had I 
packed my tooth-brush? I don’t know how it is, but I never do 
know whether I’ve packed my tooth-brush.

My tooth-brush is a thing that haunts me when I’m travel-
ling, and makes my life a misery. I dream that I haven’t packed 
it, and wake up in a cold perspiration, and get out of bed and 
hunt for it. And, in the morning, I pack it before I have used 
it, and have to unpack again to get it, and it is always the last 
thing I turn out of the bag; and then I repack and forget it, and 
have to rush upstairs for it at the last moment and carry it to 
the railway station, wrapped up in my pocket-handkerchief.

Of  course  I  had  to  turn  every  mortal  thing  out  now,  and, 
of course, I could not find it. I rummaged the things up into 
much  the  same  state  that  they  must  have  been  before  the 
world was created, and when chaos reigned. Of course, I found 
George’s and Harris’s eighteen times over, but I couldn’t find 
my own. I put the things back one by one, and held everything 
up and shook it. Then I found it inside a boot. I repacked once 
more.

When I had finished, George asked if the soap was in. I said 
I  didn’t  care  a  hang  whether  the  soap  was  in  or  whether  it 
wasn’t; and I slammed the bag to and strapped it, and found 
that I had packed my tobacco-pouch in it, and had to re-open 
it. It got shut up finally at 10.5 p.m., and then there remained 
the hampers to do. Harris said that we should be wanting to 
start in less than twelve hours’ time, and thought that he and 
George had better do the rest; and I agreed and sat down, and 
they had a go.

They  began  in  a  light-hearted  spirit,  evidently  intending 

— 42 —

to show me how to do it. I made no comment; I only waited. 
When George is hanged, Harris will be the worst packer in this 
world; and I looked at the piles of plates and cups, and kettles, 
and bottles and jars, and pies, and stoves, and cakes, and toma-
toes, &c., and felt that the thing would soon become exciting.
It did. They started with breaking a cup. That was the first 
thing they did. They did that just to show you what they could 
do, and to get you interested.

Then Harris packed the strawberry jam on top of a tomato 
and squashed it, and they had to pick out the tomato with a 
teaspoon.

And then it was George’s turn, and he trod on the butter. I 
didn’t say anything, but I came over and sat on the edge of the 
table and watched them. It irritated them more than anything 
I could have said. I felt that. It made them nervous and excited, 
and they stepped on things, and put things behind them, and 
then  couldn’t  find  them  when  they  wanted  them;  and  they 
packed the pies at the bottom, and put heavy things on top, 
and smashed the pies in.

They  upset  salt  over  everything,  and  as  for  the  butter!  I 
never saw two men do more with one-and-twopence worth of 
butter in my whole life than they did. After George had got it 
off his slipper, they tried to put it in the kettle. It wouldn’t go 
in, and what was in wouldn’t come out. They did scrape it out 
at last, and put it down on a chair, and Harris sat on it, and it 
stuck to him, and they went looking for it all over the room.

“I’ll take my oath I put it down on that chair,” said George, 

staring at the empty seat.

“I saw you do it myself, not a minute ago,” said Harris.
Then they started round the room again looking for it; and 

then they met again in the centre, and stared at one another.

“Most extraordinary thing I ever heard of,” said George.
“So mysterious!” said Harris.
Then George got round at the back of Harris and saw it.
“Why, here it is all the time,” he exclaimed, indignantly.
“Where?” cried Harris, spinning round.

— 43 —

“Stand still, can’t you!” roared George, flying after him.
And they got it off, and packed it in the teapot.
Montmorency was in it all, of course. Montmorency’s am-
bition in life, is to get in the way and be sworn at. If he can 
squirm in anywhere where he particularly is not wanted, and 
be a perfect nuisance, and make people mad, and have things 
thrown at his head, then he feels his day has not been wasted.
To get somebody to stumble over him, and curse him stead-
ily for an hour, is his highest aim and object; and, when he has 
succeeded  in  accomplishing  this,  his  conceit  becomes  quite 
unbearable.

He  came  and  sat  down  on  things,  just  when  they  were 
wanted to be packed; and he laboured under the fixed belief 
that,  whenever  Harris  or  George  reached  out  their  hand  for 
anything, it was his cold, damp nose that they wanted. He put 
his  leg  into  the  jam,  and  he  worried  the  teaspoons,  and  he 
pretended that the lemons were rats, and got into the hamper 
and killed three of them before Harris could land him with the 
frying-pan.

Harris said I encouraged him. I didn’t encourage him. A dog 
like that don’t want any encouragement. It’s the natural, origi-
nal sin that is born in him that makes him do things like that.
The packing was done at 12.50; and Harris sat on the big 
hamper, and said he hoped nothing would be found broken. 
George said that if anything was broken it was broken, which 
reflection seemed to comfort him. He also said he was ready 
for bed.

We were all ready for bed. Harris was to sleep with us that 

night, and we went upstairs.

We  tossed  for  beds,  and  Harris  had  to  sleep  with  me.  He 

said:

“Do you prefer the inside or the outside, J.?”
I said I generally preferred to sleep inside a bed.
Harris said it was old.
George said:
“What time shall I wake you fellows?”

— 44 —

Harris said:
“Seven.”
I said:
“No — six,” because I wanted to write some letters.
Harris and I had a bit of a row over it, but at last split the 

difference, and said half-past six.

“Wake us at 6.30, George,” we said.
George made no answer, and we found, on going over, that 
he had been asleep for some time; so we placed the bath where 
he  could  tumble  into  it  on  getting  out  in  the  morning,  and 
went to bed ourselves.

— 45 —

CHAPTER V.

Mrs.  P.  arouses  us. — George,  the  sluggard. — The “weather  fore-
cast” swindle. — Our luggage. — Depravity of the small boy. — The 
people gather round us. — We drive off in great style, and arrive at 
Waterloo. — Innocence of South Western officials concerning such 
worldly things as trains. — We are afloat, afloat in an open boat.

IT was Mrs. Poppets that woke me up next morning.

She said:
“Do you know that it’s nearly nine o’clock, sir?”
“Nine o’ what?” I cried, starting up.
“Nine o’clock,” she replied, through the keyhole. “I thought 

you was a-oversleeping yourselves.”

I woke Harris, and told him. He said:
“I thought you wanted to get up at six?”
“So I did,” I answered; “why didn’t you wake me?”
“How  could  I  wake  you,  when  you  didn’t  wake  me?”  he 
retorted. “Now  we  shan’t  get  on  the  water  till  after  twelve.  I 
wonder you take the trouble to get up at all.”

“Um,” I replied, “lucky for you that I do. If I hadn’t woke you, 

you’d have lain there for the whole fortnight.”

We  snarled  at  one  another  in  this  strain  for  the  next  few 
minutes,  when  we  were  interrupted  by  a  defiant  snore  from 
George.

It reminded us, for the first time since our being called, of 

his existence.

There he lay — the man who had wanted to know what time 
he should wake us — on his back, with his mouth wide open, 
and his knees stuck up.

I don’t know why it should be, I am sure; but the sight of 
another  man  asleep  in  bed  when  I  am  up,  maddens  me.  It 
seems to me so shocking to see the precious hours of a man’s 
life — the priceless moments that will never come back to him 
again — being wasted in mere brutish sleep.

There was George, throwing away in hideous sloth the ines-
timable gift of time; his valuable life, every second of which he 
would have to account for hereafter, passing away from him, 

— 46 —

unused. He might have been up stuffing himself with eggs and 
bacon, irritating the dog, or flirting with the slavey, instead of 
sprawling there, sunk in soul-clogging oblivion.

It was a terrible thought. Harris and I appeared to be struck 
by it at the same instant. We determined to save him, and, in 
this  noble  resolve,  our  own  dispute  was  forgotten.  We  flew 
across and slung the clothes off him, and Harris landed him 
one with a slipper, and I shouted in his ear, and he awoke.

“Wassermarrer?” he observed, sitting up.
“Get up, you fat-headed chunk!” roared Harris. “It’s quarter 

to ten.”

“What!”  he  shrieked,  jumping  out  of  bed  into  the  bath; 

“Who the thunder put this thing here?”

We told him he must have been a fool not to see the bath.
We finished dressing, and, when it came to the extras, we 
remembered  that  we  had  packed  the  tooth-brushes  and  the 
brush and comb (that tooth-brush of mine will be the death 
of me, I know), and we had to go downstairs, and fish them 
out of the bag. And when we had done that George wanted the 
shaving tackle. We told him that he would have to go without 
shaving that morning, as we weren’t going to unpack that bag 
again for him, nor for anyone like him.

He said:
“Don’t be absurd. How can I go into the City like this?”
It was certainly rather rough on the City, but what cared we 
for human suffering? As Harris said, in his common, vulgar 
way, the City would have to lump it.

We went downstairs to breakfast. Montmorency had invited 
two other dogs to come and see him off, and they were whiling 
away the time by fighting on the doorstep. We calmed them 
with an umbrella, and sat down to chops and cold beef.

Harris said:
“The great thing is to make a good breakfast,” and he started 
with a couple of chops, saying that he would take these while 
they were hot, as the beef could wait.

George got hold of the paper, and read us out the boating 

— 47 —

fatalities,  and  the  weather  forecast,  which  latter  prophesied 
“rain, cold, wet to fine” (whatever more than usually ghastly 
thing  in  weather  that  may  be),  “occasional  local  thunder-
storms, east wind, with general depression over the Midland 
Counties (London and Channel). Bar. falling.”

I do think that, of all the silly, irritating tomfoolishness by 
which we are plagued, this “weather-forecast” fraud is about 
the  most  aggravating.  It “forecasts”  precisely  what  happened 
yesterday  or  a  the  day  before,  and  precisely  the  opposite  of 
what is going to happen to-day.

I remember a holiday of mine being completely ruined one 
late autumn by our paying attention to the weather report of 
the  local  newspaper.  “Heavy  showers,  with  thunderstorms, 
may be expected to-day,” it would say on Monday, and so we 
would  give  up  our  picnic,  and  stop  indoors  all  day,  waiting 
for the rain. — And people would pass the house, going off in 
wagonettes and coaches as jolly and merry as could be, the sun 
shining out, and not a cloud to be seen.

“Ah!” we said, as we stood looking out at them through the 

window, “won’t they come home soaked!”

And we chuckled to think how wet they were going to get, 
and came back and stirred the fire, and got our books, and ar-
ranged our specimens of seaweed and cockle shells. By twelve 
o’clock, with the sun pouring into the room, the heat became 
quite oppressive, and we wondered when those heavy showers 
and occasional thunderstorms were going to begin.

“Ah! they’ll come in the afternoon, you’ll find,” we said to 

each other. “Oh, won’t those people get wet. What a lark!”

At  one  o’clock,  the  landlady  would  come  in  to  ask  if  we 

weren’t going out, as it seemed such a lovely day.

“No, no,” we replied, with a knowing chuckle, “not we. We 

don’t mean to get wet — no, no.”

And when the afternoon was nearly gone, and still there was 
no sign of rain, we tried to cheer ourselves up with the idea 
that  it  would  come  down  all  at  once,  just  as  the  people  had 
started for home, and were out of the reach of any shelter, and 

— 48 —

that they would thus get more drenched than ever. But not a 
drop ever fell, and it finished a grand day, and a lovely night 
after it.

The next morning we would read that it was going to be a 
“warm, fine to set-fair day; much heat;” and we would dress 
ourselves in flimsy things, and go out, and, half-an-hour after 
we had started, it would commence to rain hard, and a bitterly 
cold wind would spring up, and both would keep on steadily 
for the whole day, and we would come home with colds and 
rheumatism all over us, and go to bed.

The weather is a thing that is beyond me altogether. I never 
can understand it. The barometer is useless: it is as misleading 
as the newspaper forecast.

There was one hanging up in a hotel at Oxford at which I 
was staying last spring, and, when I got there, it was pointing 
to “set fair.” It was simply pouring with rain outside, and had 
been all day; and I couldn’t quite make matters out. I tapped 
the barometer, and it jumped up and pointed to “very dry.” The 
Boots stopped as he was passing, and said he expected it meant 
to-morrow. I fancied that maybe it was thinking of the week 
before last, but Boots said, No, he thought not.

I tapped it again the next morning, and it went up still high-
er, and the rain came down faster than ever. On Wednesday I 
went and hit it again, and the pointer went round towards “set 
fair,” “very dry,” and “much heat,” until it was stopped by the 
peg, and couldn’t go any further. It tried its best, but the instru-
ment was built so that it couldn’t prophesy fine weather any 
harder than it did without breaking itself. It evidently wanted 
to  go  on,  and  prognosticate  drought,  and  water  famine,  and 
sunstroke,  and  simooms,  and  such  things,  but  the  peg  pre-
vented it, and it had to be content with pointing to the mere 
commonplace “very dry.”

Meanwhile, the rain came down in a steady torrent, and the 
lower part of the town was under water, owing to the river hav-
ing overflowed.

Boots said it was evident that we were going to have a pro-

— 49 —

longed spell of grand weather some time, and read out a poem 
which was printed over the top of the oracle, about

“Long foretold, long last;
Short notice, soon past.”

The fine weather never came that summer. I expect that ma-

chine must have been referring to the following spring.

Then  there  are  those  new  style  of  barometers,  the  long 
straight ones. I never can make head or tail of those. There is 
one side for 10 a.m. yesterday, and one side for 10 a.m. to-day; 
but you can’t always get there as early as ten, you know. It rises 
or falls for rain and fine, with much or less wind, and one end 
is “Nly” and the other “Ely” (what’s Ely got to do with it?), and 
if you tap it, it doesn’t tell you anything. And you’ve got to cor-
rect it to sea-level, and reduce it to Fahrenheit, and even then I 
don’t know the answer.

But who wants to be foretold the weather? It is bad enough 
when  it  comes,  without  our  having  the  misery  of  knowing 
about it beforehand. The prophet we like is the old man who, 
on  the  particularly  gloomy-looking  morning  of  some  day 
when we particularly want it to be fine, looks round the hori-
zon with a particularly knowing eye, and says:

“Oh no, sir, I think it will clear up all right. It will break all 

right enough, sir.”

“Ah, he knows”, we say, as we wish him good-morning, and 

start off; “wonderful how these old fellows can tell!”

And  we  feel  an  affection  for  that  man  which  is  not  at  all 
lessened by the circumstances of its not clearing up, but con-
tinuing to rain steadily all day.

“Ah, well,” we feel, “he did his best.”
For the man that prophesies us bad weather, on the contrary, 

we entertain only bitter and revengeful thoughts.

“Going  to  clear  up,  d’ye  think?”  we  shout,  cheerily,  as  we 

pass.

— 50 —

“Well,  no,  sir;  I’m  afraid  it’s  settled  down  for  the  day,”  he 

replies, shaking his head.

“Stupid  old  fool!”  we  mutter, “what’s  he  know  about  it?” 
And, if his portent proves correct, we come back feeling still 
more angry against him, and with a vague notion that, some-
how or other, he has had something to do with it.

It  was  too  bright  and  sunny  on  this  especial  morning  for 
George’s blood-curdling readings about “Bar. falling,” “atmos-
pheric disturbance, passing in an oblique line over Southern 
Europe,” and “pressure increasing,” to very much upset us: and 
so, finding that he could not make us wretched, and was only 
wasting his time, he sneaked the cigarette that I had carefully 
rolled up for myself, and went.

Then Harris and I, having finished up the few things left on 
the table, carted out our luggage on to the doorstep, and waited 
for a cab.

There  seemed  a  good  deal  of  luggage,  when  we  put  it  all 
together.  There  was  the  Gladstone  and  the  small  hand-bag, 
and the two hampers, and a large roll of rugs, and some four 
or five overcoats and macintoshes, and a few umbrellas, and 
then there was a melon by itself in a bag, because it was too 
bulky to go in anywhere, and a couple of pounds of grapes in 
another bag, and a Japanese paper umbrella, and a frying pan, 
which,  being  too  long  to  pack,  we  had  wrapped  round  with 
brown paper.

It  did  look  a  lot,  and  Harris  and  I  began  to  feel  rather 
ashamed of it, though why we should be, I can’t see. No cab 
came by, but the street boys did, and got interested in the show, 
apparently, and stopped.

Biggs’s boy was the first to come round. Biggs is our green-
grocer, and his chief talent lies in securing the services of the 
most abandoned and unprincipled errand-boys that civilisa-
tion has as yet produced. If anything more than usually villain-
ous in the boy-line crops up in our neighbourhood, we know 
that it is Biggs’s latest. I was told that, at the time of the Great 
Coram Street murder, it was promptly concluded by our street 

— 51 —

that Biggs’s boy (for that period) was at the bottom of it, and 
had he not been able, in reply to the severe cross-examination 
to which he was subjected by No. 19, when he called there for 
orders the morning after the crime (assisted by No. 21, who 
happened to be on the step at the time), to prove a complete al-
ibi, it would have gone hard with him. I didn’t know Biggs’s boy 
at that time, but, from what I have seen of them since, I should 
not have attached much importance to that alibi myself.

Biggs’s boy, as I have said, came round the corner. He was ev-
idently in a great hurry when he first dawned upon the vision, 
but,  on  catching  sight  of  Harris  and  me,  and  Montmorency, 
and the things, he eased up and stared. Harris and I frowned 
at him. This might have wounded a more sensitive nature, but 
Biggs’s boys are not, as a rule, touchy. He came to a dead stop, 
a yard from our step, and, leaning up against the railings, and 
selecting a straw to chew, fixed us with his eye. He evidently 
meant to see this thing out.

In another moment, the grocer’s boy passed on the opposite 

side of the street. Biggs’s boy hailed him:

“Hi! ground floor o’ 42’s a-moving.”
The  grocer’s  boy  came  across,  and  took  up  a  position  on 
the other side of the step. Then the young gentleman from the 
boot-shop stopped, and joined Biggs’s boy; while the empty-
can  superintendent  from “The  Blue  Posts”  took  up  an  inde-
pendent position on the curb.

“They ain’t a-going to starve, are they?” said the gentleman 

from the boot-shop.

“Ah! you’d want to take a thing or two with you,” retorted 
“The Blue Posts,” “if you was a-going to cross the Atlantic in 
a small boat.”

“They ain’t a-going to cross the Atlantic,” struck in Biggs’s 

boy; “they’re a-going to find Stanley.”

By this time, quite a small crowd had collected, and people 
were asking each other what was the matter. One party (the 
young and giddy portion of the crowd) held that it was a wed-
ding,  and  pointed  out  Harris  as  the  bridegroom;  while  the 

— 52 —

elder and more thoughtful among the populace inclined to the 
idea that it was a funeral, and that I was probably the corpse’s 
brother.

At  last,  an  empty  cab  turned  up  (it  is  a  street  where,  as  a 
rule, and when they are not wanted, empty cabs pass at the rate 
of three a minute, and hang about, and get in your way), and 
packing ourselves and our belongings into it, and shooting out 
a couple of Montmorency’s friends, who had evidently sworn 
never to forsake him, we drove away amidst the cheers of the 
crowd, Biggs’s boy shying a carrot after us for luck.

We got to Waterloo at eleven, and asked where the eleven-
five started from. Of course nobody knew; nobody at Water-
loo  ever  does  know  where  a  train  is  going  to  start  from,  or 
where a train when it does start is going to, or anything about 
it. The porter who took our things thought it would go from 
number  two  platform,  while  another  porter,  with  whom  he 
discussed the question, had heard a rumour that it would go 
from number one. The station-master, on the other hand, was 
convinced it would start from the local.

To  put  an  end  to  the  matter,  we  went  upstairs,  and  asked 
the traffic superintendent, and he told us that he had just met 
a man, who said he had seen it at number three platform. We 
went to number three platform, but the authorities there said 
that they rather thought that train was the Southampton ex-
press, or else the Windsor loop. But they were sure it wasn’t 
the Kingston train, though why they were sure it wasn’t they 
couldn’t say.

Then our porter said he thought that must be it on the high-
level platform; said he thought he knew the train. So we went to 
the high-level platform, and saw the engine-driver, and asked 
him if he was going to Kingston. He said he couldn’t say for 
certain of course, but that he rather thought he was. Anyhow, 
if he wasn’t the 11.5 for Kingston, he said he was pretty confi-
dent he was the 9.32 for Virginia Water, or the 10 a.m. express 
for the Isle of Wight, or somewhere in that direction, and we 

— 53 —

should all know when we got there. We slipped half-a-crown 
into his hand, and begged him to be the 11.5 for Kingston.

“Nobody will ever know, on this line,” we said, “what you 
are, or where you’re going. You know the way, you slip off qui-
etly and go to Kingston.”

“Well,  I  don’t  know,  gents,”  replied  the  noble  fellow, “but 
I  suppose  some  train’s  got  to  go  to  Kingston;  and  I’ll  do  it. 
Gimme the half-crown.”

Thus we got to Kingston by the London and South-Western 

Railway.

We learnt, afterwards, that the train we had come by was re-
ally the Exeter mail, and that they had spent hours at Waterloo, 
looking for it, and nobody knew what had become of it.

Our boat was waiting for us at Kingston just below bridge, 
and to it we wended our way, and round it we stored our lug-
gage, and into it we stepped.

“Are you all right, sir?” said the man.
“Right it is,” we answered; and with Harris at the sculls and 
I  at  the  tiller-lines,  and  Montmorency,  unhappy  and  deeply 
suspicious, in the prow, out we shot on to the waters which, for 
a fortnight, were to be our home.

Harris as a guide.

IT was a glorious morning, late spring or early summer, as you 
care to take it, when the dainty sheen of grass and leaf is blush-
ing  to  a  deeper  green;  and  the  year  seems  like  a  fair  young 
maid, trembling with strange, wakening pulses on the brink of 
womanhood.

The quaint back streets of Kingston, where they came down 
to  the  water’s  edge,  looked  quite  picturesque  in  the  flashing 
sunlight, the glinting river with its drifting barges, the wooded 
towpath,  the  trim-kept  villas  on  the  other  side,  Harris,  in  a 
red and orange blazer, grunting away at the sculls, the distant 
glimpses of the grey old palace of the Tudors, all made a sunny 
picture, so bright but calm, so full of life, and yet so peaceful, 
that, early in the day though it was, I felt myself being dreamily 
lulled off into a musing fit.

I  mused  on  Kingston,  or  “Kyningestun,”  as  it  was  once 
called in the days when Saxon “kinges” were crowned there. 
Great Caesar crossed the river there, and the Roman legions 
camped upon its sloping uplands. Caesar, like, in later years, 
Elizabeth,  seems  to  have  stopped  everywhere:  only  he  was 
more respectable than good Queen Bess; he didn’t put up at 
the public-houses.

She  was  nuts  on  public-houses,  was  England’s  Virgin 
Queen.  There’s  scarcely  a  pub.  of  any  attractions  within  ten 
miles of London that she does not seem to have looked in at, 
or stopped at, or slept at, some time or other. I wonder now, 
supposing Harris, say, turned over a new leaf, and became a 
great and good man, and got to be Prime Minister, and died, 
if they would put up signs over the public-houses that he had 
patronised: “Harris had a glass of bitter in this house;” “Harris 

— 55 —

had two of Scotch cold here in the summer of ’88;” “Harris was 
chucked from here in December, 1886.”

No,  there  would  be  too  many  of  them!  It  would  be  the 
houses that he had never entered that would become famous. 
“Only house in South London that Harris never had a drink 
in!” The people would flock to it to see what could have been 
the matter with it.

How  poor  weak-minded  King  Edwy  must  have  hated  Ky-
ningestun! The coronation feast had been too much for him. 
Maybe boar’s head stuffed with sugar-plums did not agree with 
him (it wouldn’t with me, I know), and he had had enough of 
sack and mead; so he slipped from the noisy revel to steal a 
quiet moonlight hour with his beloved Elgiva.

Perhaps,  from  the  casement,  standing  hand-in-hand,  they 
were watching the calm moonlight on the river, while from the 
distant halls the boisterous revelry floated in broken bursts of 
faint-heard din and tumult.

Then brutal Odo and St. Dunstan force their rude way into 
the  quiet  room,  and  hurl  coarse  insults  at  the  sweet-faced 
Queen, and drag poor Edwy back to the loud clamour of the 
drunken brawl.

Years  later,  to  the  crash  of  battle-music,  Saxon  kings  and 
Saxon revelry were buried side by side, and Kingston’s great-
ness passed away for a time, to rise once more when Hampton 
Court became the palace of the Tudors and the Stuarts, and 
the royal barges strained at their moorings on the river’s bank, 
and  bright-cloaked  gallants  swaggered  down  the  water-steps 
to cry: “What Ferry, ho! Gadzooks, gramercy.”

Many of the old houses, round about, speak very plainly of 
those  days  when  Kingston  was  a  royal  borough,  and  nobles 
and courtiers lived there, near their King, and the long road to 
the palace gates was gay all day with clanking steel and pranc-
ing palfreys, and rustling silks and velvets, and fair faces. The 
large and spacious houses, with their oriel, latticed windows, 
their  huge  fireplaces,  and  their  gabled  roofs,  breathe  of  the 
days  of  hose  and  doublet,  of  pearl-embroidered  stomachers, 

— 56 —

and complicated oaths. They were upraised in the days “when 
men knew how to build.” The hard red bricks have only grown 
more firmly set with time, and their oak stairs do not creak 
and grunt when you try to go down them quietly.

Speaking of oak staircases reminds me that there is a mag-
nificent carved oak staircase in one of the houses in Kingston. 
It is a shop now, in the market-place, but it was evidently once 
the mansion of some great personage. A friend of mine, who 
lives at Kingston, went in there to buy a hat one day, and, in a 
thoughtless moment, put his hand in his pocket and paid for 
it then and there.

The  shopman  (he  knows  my  friend)  was  naturally  a  little 
staggered  at  first;  but,  quickly  recovering  himself,  and  feel-
ing  that  something  ought  to  be  done  to  encourage  this  sort 
of thing, asked our hero if he would like to see some fine old 
carved oak. My friend said he would, and the shopman, there-
upon, took him through the shop, and up the staircase of the 
house. The balusters were a superb piece of workmanship, and 
the  wall  all  the  way  up  was  oak-panelled,  with  carving  that 
would have done credit to a palace.

From  the  stairs,  they  went  into  the  drawing-room,  which 
was a large, bright room, decorated with a somewhat startling 
though cheerful paper of a blue ground. There was nothing, 
however, remarkable about the apartment, and my friend won-
dered why he had been brought there. The proprietor went up 
to the paper, and tapped it. It gave forth a wooden sound.

“Oak,” he explained. “All carved oak, right up to the ceiling, 

just the same as you saw on the staircase.”

“But, great Cæsar! man,” expostulated my friend; “you don’t 
mean to say you have covered over carved oak with blue wall-
paper?”

“Yes,” was the reply: “it was expensive work. Had to match-
board it all over first, of course. But the room looks cheerful 
now. It was awful gloomy before.”

I can’t say I altogether blame the man (which is doubtless a 
great relief to his mind). From his point of view, which would 

— 57 —

be  that  of  the  average  householder,  desiring  to  take  life  as 
lightly as possible, and not that of the old-curiosity-shop ma-
niac, there is reason on his side. Carved oak is very pleasant 
to look at, and to have a little of, but it is no doubt somewhat 
depressing to live in, for those whose fancy does not lie that 
way. It would be like living in a church.

No, what was sad in his case was that he, who didn’t care for 
carved  oak,  should  have  his  drawing-room  panelled  with  it, 
while people who do care for it have to pay enormous prices 
to get it. It seems to be the rule of this world. Each person has 
what  he  doesn’t  want,  and  other  people  have  what  he  does 
want.

Married men have wives, and don’t seem to want them; and 
young  single  fellows  cry  out  that  they  can’t  get  them.  Poor 
people  who  can  hardly  keep  themselves  have  eight  hearty 
children. Rich old couples, with no one to leave their money 
to, die childless.

Then there are girls with lovers. The girls that have lovers 
never want them. They say they would rather be without them, 
that they bother them, and why don’t they go and make love 
to Miss Smith and Miss Brown, who are plain and elderly, and 
haven’t  got  any  lovers?  They  themselves  don’t  want  lovers. 
They never mean to marry.

It does not do to dwell on these things; it makes one so sad.
There was a boy at our school, we used to call him Sandford 
and  Merton.  His  real  name  was  Stivvings.  He  was  the  most 
extraordinary lad I ever came across. I believe he really liked 
study. He used to get into awful rows for sitting up in bed and 
reading  Greek;  and  as  for  French  irregular  verbs  there  was 
simply no keeping him away from them. He was full of weird 
and unnatural notions about being a credit to his parents and 
an  honour  to  the  school;  and  he  yearned  to  win  prizes,  and 
grow up and be a clever man, and had all those sorts of weak-
minded ideas. I never knew such a strange creature, yet harm-
less, mind you, as the babe unborn.

Well, that boy used to get ill about twice a week, so that he 

— 58 —

couldn’t  go  to  school.  There  never  was  such  a  boy  to  get  ill 
as that Sandford and Merton. If there was any known disease 
going within ten miles of him, he had it, and had it badly. He 
would take bronchitis in the dog-days, and have hay-fever at 
Christmas. After a six weeks’ period of drought, he would be 
stricken down with rheumatic fever; and he would go out in a 
November fog and come home with a sunstroke.

They  put  him  under  laughing-gas  one  year,  poor  lad,  and 
drew all his teeth, and gave him a false set, because he suffered 
so terribly with toothache; and then it turned to neuralgia and 
ear-ache.  He  was  never  without  a  cold,  except  once  for  nine 
weeks while he had scarlet fever; and he always had chilblains. 
During  the  great  cholera  scare  of  1871,  our  neighbourhood 
was singularly free from it. There was only one reputed case in 
the whole parish: that case was young Stivvings.

He had to stop in bed when he was ill, and eat chicken and 
custards and hot-house grapes; and he would lie there and sob, 
because they wouldn’t let him do Latin exercises, and took his 
German grammar away from him.

And we other boys, who would have sacrificed ten terms of 
our school-life for the sake of being ill for a day, and had no 
desire whatever to give our parents any excuse for being stuck-
up about us, couldn’t catch so much as a stiff neck. We fooled 
about in draughts, and it did us good, and freshened us up; and 
we took things to make us sick, and they made us fat, and gave 
us an appetite. Nothing we could think of seemed to make us 
ill until the holidays began. Then, on the breaking-up day, we 
caught colds, and whooping cough, and all kinds of disorders, 
which  lasted  till  the  term  recommenced;  when,  in  spite  of 
everything we could manoeuvre to the contrary, we would get 
suddenly well again, and be better than ever.

Such is life; and we are but as grass that is cut down, and put 

into the oven and baked.

To go back to the carved-oak question, they must have had 
very fair notions of the artistic and the beautiful, our great-
great-grandfathers.  Why,  all  our  art  treasures  of  to-day  are 

— 59 —

only the dug-up commonplaces of three or four hundred years 
ago. I wonder if there is real intrinsic beauty in the old soup-
plates,  beer-mugs,  and  candle-snuffers  that  we  prize  so  now, 
or if it is only the halo of age glowing around them that gives 
them  their  charms  in  our  eyes.  The “old  blue”  that  we  hang 
about  our  walls  as  ornaments  were  the  common  every-day 
household utensils of a few centuries ago; and the pink shep-
herds and the yellow shepherdesses that we hand round now 
for all our friends to gush over, and pretend they understand, 
were the unvalued mantel-ornaments that the mother of the 
eighteenth century would have given the baby to suck when 
he cried.

Will it be the same in the future? Will the prized treasures 
of to-day always be the cheap trifles of the day before? Will 
rows  of  our  willow-pattern  dinner-plates  be  ranged  above 
the  chimneypieces  of  the  great  in  the  years  2000  and  odd? 
Will the white cups with the gold rim and the beautiful gold 
flower  inside  species  unknown),  that  our  Sarah  Janes  now 
break in sheer light-heartedness of spirit, be carefully mended, 
and stood upon a bracket, and dusted only by the lady of the 
house?

That  china  dog  that  ornaments  the  bedroom  of  my  fur-
nished lodgings. It is a white dog. Its eyes are blue. Its nose is 
a delicate red, with black spots. Its head is painfully erect, its 
expression is amiability carried to verge of imbecility. I do not 
admire it myself. Considered as a work of art, I may say it ir-
ritates me. Thoughtless friends jeer at it, and even my landlady 
herself has no admiration for it, and excuses its presence by 
the circumstance that her aunt gave it to her.

But in 200 years’ time it is more than probable that that dog 
will be dug up from somewhere or other, minus its legs, and 
with its tail broken, and will be sold for old china, and put in 
a glass cabinet. And people will pass it round, and admire it. 
They will be struck by the wonderful depth of the colour on 
the nose, and speculate as to how beautiful the bit of the tail 
that is lost no doubt was.

— 60 —

We, in this age, do not see the beauty of that dog. We are 
too familiar with it. It is like the sunset and the stars: we are 
not awed by their loveliness because they are common to our 
eyes. So it is with that china dog. In 2288 people will gush over 
it. The making of such dogs will have become a lost art. Our 
descendants  will  wonder  how  we  did  it,  and  say  how  clever 
we were. We shall be referred to lovingly as “those grand old 
artists that flourished in the nineteenth century, and produced 
those china dogs.”

The “sampler”  that  the  eldest  daughter  did  at  school  will 
be  spoken  of  as “tapestry  of  the  Victorian  era,”  and  be  al-
most  priceless.  The  blue-and-white  mugs  of  the  present-day 
roadside inn will be hunted up, all cracked and chipped, and 
sold  for  their  weight  in  gold,  and  rich  people  will  use  them 
for claret cups; and travellers from Japan will buy up all the 
“Presents  from  Ramsgate,”  and “Souvenirs  of  Margate,”  that 
may have escaped destruction, and take them back to Jedo as 
ancient English curios.

At this point Harris threw away the sculls, got up and left 
his  seat,  and  sat  on  his  back,  and  stuck  his  legs  in  the  air. 
Montmorency howled, and turned a somersault, and the top 
hamper jumped up, and all the things came out.

I was somewhat surprised, but I did not lose my temper. I 

said, pleasantly enough:

“Hulloa! what’s that for?”
“What’s that for? Why —”
No, on second thoughts, I will not repeat what Harris said. 
I may have been to blame, I admit it; but nothing excuses vio-
lence of language and coarseness of expression, especially in 
a man who has been carefully brought up, as I know Harris 
has  been.  I  was  thinking  of  other  things,  and  forgot,  as  any 
one might easily understand, that I was steering, and the con-
sequence was that we had got mixed up a good deal with the 
tow-path. It was difficult to say, for the moment, which was us 
and which was the Middlesex bank of the river; but we found 
out after a while, and separated ourselves.

— 61 —

Harris,  however,  said  he  had  done  enough  for  a  bit,  and 
proposed  that  I  should  take  a  turn;  so,  as  we  were  in,  I  got 
out and took the tow-line, and ran the boat on past Hampton 
Court. What a dear old wall that is that runs along by the river 
there! I never pass it without feeling better for the sight of it. 
Such a mellow, bright, sweet old wall; what a charming picture 
it  would  make,  with  the  lichen  creeping  here,  and  the  moss 
growing there, a shy young vine peeping over the top at this 
spot, to see what is going on upon the busy river, and the sober 
old ivy clustering a little farther down! There are fifty shades 
and tints and hues in every ten yards of that old wall. If I could 
only draw, and knew how to paint, I could make a lovely sketch 
of that old wall, I’m sure. I’ve often thought I should like to live 
at Hampton Court. It looks so peaceful and so quiet, and it is 
such a dear old place to ramble round in the early morning 
before many people are about.

But, there, I don’t suppose I should really care for it when 
it came to actual practice. It would be so ghastly dull and de-
pressing in the evening, when your lamp cast uncanny shad-
ows on the panelled walls, and the echo of distant feet rang 
through the cold stone corridors, and now drew nearer, and 
now died away, and all was death-like silence, save the beating 
of one’s own heart.

We are creatures of the sun, we men and women. We love 
light and life. That is why we crowd into the towns and cities, 
and the country grows more and more deserted every year. In 
the sunlight — in the daytime, when Nature is alive and busy all 
around us, we like the open hill-sides and the deep woods well 
enough: but in the night, when our Mother Earth has gone to 
sleep,  and  left  us  waking,  oh!  the  world  seems  so  lonesome, 
and  we  get  frightened,  like  children  in  a  silent  house.  Then 
we sit and sob, and long for the gas-lit streets, and the sound 
of human voices, and the answering throb of human life. We 
feel  so  helpless  and  so  little  in  the  great  stillness,  when  the 
dark trees rustle in the night-wind. There are so many ghosts 
about, and their silent sighs make us feel so sad. Let us gather 

— 62 —

together in the great cities, and light huge bonfires of a million 
gas-jets, and shout and sing together, and feel brave.

Harris  asked  me  if  I’d  ever  been  in  the  maze  at  Hampton 
Court.  He  said  he  went  in  once  to  show  somebody  else  the 
way. He had studied it up in a map, and it was so simple that it 
seemed foolish — hardly worth the twopence charged for ad-
mission. Harris said he thought that map must have been got 
up as a practical joke, because it wasn’t a bit like the real thing, 
and only misleading. It was a country cousin that Harris took 
in. He said:

“We’ll just go in here, so that you can say you’ve been, but it’s 
very simple. It’s absurd to call it a maze. You keep on taking the 
first turning to the right. We’ll just walk round for ten minutes, 
and then go and get some lunch.”

They met some people soon after they had got inside, who 
said  they  had  been  there  for  three-quarters  of  an  hour,  and 
had had about enough of it. Harris told them they could follow 
him, if they liked; he was just going in, and then should turn 
round and come out again. They said it was very kind of him, 
and fell behind, and followed.

They  picked  up  various  other  people  who  wanted  to  get 
it  over,  as  they  went  along,  until  they  had  absorbed  all  the 
persons  in  the  maze.  People  who  had  given  up  all  hopes  of 
ever getting either in or out, or of ever seeing their home and 
friends again, plucked up courage at the sight of Harris and his 
party, and joined the procession, blessing him. Harris said he 
should judge there must have been twenty people, following 
him, in all; and one woman with a baby, who had been there 
all the morning, insisted on taking his arm, for fear of losing 
him.

Harris kept on turning to the right, but it seemed a long way, 

and his cousin said he supposed it was a very big maze.

“Oh, one of the largest in Europe,” said Harris.
“Yes, it must be,” replied the cousin, “because we’ve walked a 

good two miles already.”

Harris began to think it rather strange himself, but he held 

— 63 —

on until, at last, they passed the half of a penny bun on the 
ground that Harris’s cousin swore he had noticed there seven 
minutes  ago.  Harris  said: “Oh,  impossible!”  but  the  woman 
with the baby said, “Not at all,” as she herself had taken it from 
the child, and thrown it down there, just before she met Harris. 
She also added that she wished she never had met Harris, and 
expressed an opinion that he was an impostor. That made Har-
ris mad, and he produced his map, and explained his theory.

“The map may be all right enough,” said one of the party, “if 

you know whereabouts in it we are now.”

Harris didn’t know, and suggested that the best thing to do 
would be to go back to the entrance, and begin again. For the 
beginning  again  part  of  it  there  was  not  much  enthusiasm; 
but  with  regard  to  the  advisability  of  going  back  to  the  en-
trance there was complete unanimity, and so they turned, and 
trailed after Harris again, in the opposite direction. About ten 
minutes more passed, and then they found themselves in the 
centre.

Harris thought at first of pretending that that was what he 
had been aiming at; but the crowd looked dangerous, and he 
decided to treat it as an accident.

Anyhow, they had got something to start from then. They 
did know where they were, and the map was once more con-
sulted, and the thing seemed simpler than ever, and off they 
started for the third time.

And three minutes later they were back in the centre again.
After that, they simply couldn’t get anywhere else. Whatever 
way they turned brought them back to the middle. It became 
so  regular  at  length,  that  some  of  the  people  stopped  there, 
and waited for the others to take a walk round, and come back 
to them. Harris drew out his map again, after a while, but the 
sight of it only infuriated the mob, and they told him to go and 
curl his hair with it. Harris said that he couldn’t help feeling 
that, to a certain extent, he had become unpopular.

They all got crazy at last, and sang out for the keeper, and 
the man came and climbed up the ladder outside, and shouted 

— 64 —

out directions to them. But all their heads were, by this time, 
in  such  a  confused  whirl  that  they  were  incapable  of  grasp-
ing  anything,  and  so  the  man  told  them  to  stop  where  they 
were, and he would come to them. They huddled together, and 
waited; and he climbed down, and came in.

He was a young keeper, as luck would have it, and new to 
the business; and when he got in, he couldn’t find them, and 
he wandered about, trying to get to them, and then he got lost. 
They caught sight of him, every now and then, rushing about 
the other side of the hedge, and he would see them, and rush to 
get to them, and they would wait there for about five minutes, 
and  then  he  would  reappear  again  in  exactly  the  same  spot, 
and ask them where they had been.

They had to wait till one of the old keepers came back from 

his dinner before they got out.

Harris said he thought it was a very fine maze, so far as he 
was a judge; and we agreed that we would try to get George to 
go into it, on our way back.

CHAPTER VII.

The river in its Sunday garb. — Dress on the river. — A chance for 
the men. — Absence of taste in Harris. — George’s blazer. — A day 
with the fashion-plate young lady. — Mrs. Thomas’s tomb. — The 
man who loves not graves and coffins and skulls. — Harris mad. — 
His  views  on  George  and  banks  and  lemonade. — He  performs 

tricks.

IT was while passing through Moulsey Lock that Harris told 
me about his maze experience. It took us some time to pass 
through, as we were the only boat, and it is a big lock. I don’t 
think I ever remember to have seen Moulsey Lock, before, with 
only one boat in it. It is, I suppose, Boulter’s not even excepted, 
the busiest lock on the river.

I have stood and watched it, sometimes, when you could not 
see any water at all, but only a brilliant tangle of bright blaz-
ers, and gay caps, and saucy hats, and many-coloured parasols, 
and silken rugs, and cloaks, and streaming ribbons, and dainty 
whites; when looking down into the lock from the quay, you 
might fancy it was a huge box into which flowers of every hue 
and  shade  had  been  thrown  pell-mell,  and  lay  piled  up  in  a 
rainbow heap, that covered every corner.

On a fine Sunday it presents this appearance nearly all day 
long, while, up the stream, and down the stream, lie, waiting 
their turn, outside the gates, long lines of still more boats; and 
boats  are  drawing  near  and  passing  away,  so  that  the  sunny 
river, from the Palace up to Hampton Church, is dotted and 
decked with yellow, and blue, and orange, and white, and red, 
and pink. All the inhabitants of Hampton and Moulsey dress 
themselves  up  in  boating  costume,  and  come  and  mouch 
round the lock with their dogs, and flirt, and smoke, and watch 
the  boats;  and,  altogether,  what  with  the  caps  and  jackets  of 
the men, the pretty coloured dresses of the women, the excited 
dogs, the moving boats, the white sails, the pleasant landscape, 
and the sparkling water, it is one of the gayest sights I know of 
near this dull old London town.

The river affords a good opportunity for dress. For once in a 

— 66 —

way, we men are able to show our taste in colours, and I think 
we come out very natty, if you ask me. I always like a little red 
in my things — red and black. You know my hair is a sort of 
golden brown, rather a pretty shade I’ve been told, and a dark 
red matches it beautifully; and then I always think a light-blue 
necktie goes so well with it, and a pair of those Russian-leather 
shoes and a red silk handkerchief round the waist — a hand-
kerchief looks so much better than a belt.

Harris always keeps to shades or mixtures of orange or yel-
low, but I don’t think he is at all wise in this. His complexion 
is too dark for yellows. Yellows don’t suit him: there can be no 
question about it. I want him to take to blue as a background, 
with white or cream for relief; but, there! the less taste a per-
son has in dress, the more obstinate he always seems to be. It 
is a great pity, because he will never be a success as it is, while 
there are one or two colours in which he might not really look 
so bad, with his hat on.

George has bought some new things for this trip, and I’m 
rather  vexed  about  them.  The  blazer  is  loud.  I  should  not 
like George to know that I thought so, but there really is no 
other word for it. He brought it home and showed it to us on 
Thursday evening. We asked him what colour he called it, and 
he said he didn’t know. He didn’t think there was a name for 
the colour. The man had told him it was an Oriental design. 
George put it on, and asked us what we thought of it. Harris 
said that, as an object to hang over a flower-bed in early spring 
to frighten the birds away, he should respect it; but that, con-
sidered  as  an  article  of  dress  for  any  human  being,  except  a 
Margate nigger, it made him ill. George got quite huffy; but, as 
Harris said, if he didn’t want his opinion, why did he ask for it?
What troubles Harris and myself, with regard to it, is that we 

are afraid it will attract attention to the boat.

Girls, also, don’t look half bad in a boat, if prettily dressed. 
Nothing is more fetching, to my thinking, than a tasteful boat-
ing costume. But a “boating costume,” it would be as well if all 
ladies would understand, ought to be a costume that can be 

— 67 —

worn in a boat, and not merely under a glass-case. It utterly 
spoils an excursion if you have folk in the boat who are think-
ing all the time a good deal more of their dress than of the trip. 
It was my misfortune once to go for a water picnic with two 
ladies of this kind. We did have a lively time!

They were both beautifully got up — all lace and silky stuff, 
and flowers, and ribbons, and dainty shoes, and light gloves. 
But they were dressed for a photographic studio, not for a river 
picnic. They were the “boating costumes” of a French fashion-
plate. It was ridiculous, fooling about in them anywhere near 
real earth, air, and water.

The first thing was that they thought the boat was not clean. 
We dusted all the seats for them, and then assured them that it 
was, but they didn’t believe us. One of them rubbed the cush-
ion with the forefinger of her glove, and showed the result to 
the other, and they both sighed, and sat down, with the air of 
early  Christian  martyrs  trying  to  make  themselves  comfort-
able up against the stake. You are liable to occasionally splash 
a  little  when  sculling,  and  it  appeared  that  a  drop  of  water 
ruined those costumes. The mark never came out, and a stain 
was left on the dress for ever.

I was stroke. I did my best. I feathered some two feet high, 
and I paused at the end of each stroke to let the blades drip 
before returning them, and I picked out a smooth bit of water 
to  drop  them  into  again  each  time.  (Bow  said,  after  a  while, 
that he did not feel himself a sufficiently accomplished oars-
man to pull with me, but that he would sit still, if I would al-
low him, and study my stroke. He said it interested him.) But, 
notwithstanding all this, and try as I would, I could not help an 
occasional flicker of water from going over those dresses.

The girls did not complain, but they huddled up close to-
gether, and set their lips firm, and every time a drop touched 
them, they visibly shrank and shuddered. It was a noble sight 
to see them suffering thus in silence, but it unnerved me alto-
gether. I am too sensitive. I got wild and fitful in my rowing, 
and splashed more and more, the harder I tried not to.

— 68 —

I gave it up at last; I said I’d row bow. Bow thought the ar-
rangement would be better too, and we changed places. The 
ladies gave an involuntary sigh of relief when they saw me go, 
and quite brightened up for a moment. Poor girls! they had 
better have put up with me. The man they had got now was a 
jolly, light-hearted, thick-headed sort of a chap, with about as 
much sensitiveness in him as there might be in a Newfound-
land puppy. You might look daggers at him for an hour and he 
would not notice it, and it would not trouble him if he did. He 
set a good, rollicking, dashing stroke that sent the spray play-
ing all over the boat like a fountain, and made the whole crowd 
sit up straight in no time. When he spread more than pint of 
water over one of those dresses, he would give a pleasant little 
laugh, and say:

“I beg your pardon, I’m sure;” and offer them his handker-

chief to wipe it off with.

“Oh, it’s of no consequence,” the poor girls would murmur 
in reply, and covertly draw rugs and coats over themselves, and 
try and protect themselves with their lace parasols.

At lunch they had a very bad time of it. People wanted them 
to sit on the grass, and the grass was dusty; and the tree-trunks, 
against which they were invited to lean, did not appear to have 
been brushed for weeks; so they spread their handkerchiefs on 
the ground and sat on those, bolt upright. Somebody, in walk-
ing about with a plate of beef-steak pie, tripped up over a root, 
and sent the pie flying. None of it went over them, fortunately, 
but the accident suggested a fresh danger to them, and agitated 
them;  and,  whenever  anybody  moved  about,  after  that,  with 
anything  in  his  hand  that  could  fall  and  make  a  mess,  they 
watched that person with growing anxiety until he sat down 
again.

“Now then, you girls,” said our friend Bow to them, cheerily, 

after it was all over, “come along, you’ve got to wash up!”

They didn’t understand him at first. When they grasped the 
idea, they said they feared they did not know how to wash up.
“Oh,  I’ll  soon  show  you,”  he  cried; “it’s  rare  fun!  You  lie 

— 69 —

down on your — I mean you lean over the bank, you know, and 
sloush the things about in the water.”

The elder sister said that she was afraid that they hadn’t got 

on dresses suited to the work.

“Oh, they’ll be all right,” said he light-heartedly; “tuck ’em 

up.”

And he made them do it, too. He told them that that sort 
of  thing  was  half  the  fun  of  a  picnic.  They  said  it  was  very 
interesting.

Now I come to think it over, was that young man as dense-
headed as we thought? or was he — no, impossible! there was 
such a simple, child-like expression about him!

Harris wanted to get out at Hampton Church, to go and see 

Mrs. Thomas’s tomb.

“Who is Mrs. Thomas?” I asked.
“How should I know?” replied Harris. “She’s a lady that’s got 

a funny tomb, and I want to see it.”

I objected. I don’t know whether it is that I am built wrong, 
but  I  never  did  seem  to  hanker  after  tombstones  myself.  I 
know that the proper thing to do, when you get to a village or 
town, is to rush off to the churchyard, and enjoy the graves; 
but it is a recreation that I always deny myself. I take no inter-
est in creeping round dim and chilly churches behind wheezy 
old men, and reading epitaphs. Not even the sight of a bit of 
cracked brass let into a stone affords me what I call real hap-
piness.

I  shock  respectable  sextons  by  the  imperturbability  I  am 
able to assume before exciting inscriptions, and by my lack of 
enthusiasm for the local family history, while my ill-concealed 
anxiety to get outside wounds their feelings.

One golden morning of a sunny day, I leant against the low 
stone wall that guarded a little village church, and I smoked, 
and  drank  in  deep,  calm  gladness  from  the  sweet,  restful 
scene — the  grey  old  church  with  its  clustering  ivy  and  its 
quaint carved wooden porch, the white lane winding down the 
hill between tall rows of elms, the thatched-roof cottages peep-

— 70 —

ing above their trim-kept hedges, the silver river in the hollow, 
the wooded hills beyond!

It was a lovely landscape. It was idyllic, poetical, and it in-
spired me. I felt good and noble. I felt I didn’t want to be sinful 
and wicked any more. I would come and live here, and never 
do any more wrong, and lead a blameless, beautiful life, and 
have silver hair when I got old, and all that sort of thing.

In  that  moment  I  forgave  all  my  friends  and  relations  for 
their wickedness and cussedness, and I blessed them. They did 
not know that I blessed them. They went their abandoned way 
all unconscious of what I, far away in that peaceful village, was 
doing for them; but I did it, and I wished that I could let them 
know that I had done it, because I wanted to make them happy. 
I was going on thinking away all these grand, tender thoughts, 
when my reverie was broken in upon by a shrill piping voice 
crying out:

“All right, sur, I’m a-coming, I’m a-coming. It’s all right, sur; 

don’t you be in a hurry.”

I  looked  up,  and  saw  an  old  bald-headed  man  hobbling 
across the churchyard towards me, carrying a huge bunch of 
keys in his hand that shook and jingled at every step.

I  motioned  him  away  with  silent  dignity,  but  he  still  ad-

vanced, screeching out the while:

“I’m a-coming, sur, I’m a-coming. I’m a little lame. I ain’t as 

spry as I used to be. This way, sur.”

“Go away, you miserable old man,” I said.
“I’ve come as soon as I could, sur,” he replied. “My missis 

never see you till just this minute. You follow me, sur.”

“Go away,” I repeated; “leave me before I get over the wall, 

and slay you.”

He seemed surprised.
“Don’t you want to see the tombs?” he said.
“No,” I answered, “I don’t. I want to stop here, leaning up 
against this gritty old wall. Go away, and don’t disturb me. I am 
chock full of beautiful and noble thoughts, and I want to stop 
like it, because it feels nice and good. Don’t you come fooling 

— 71 —

about, making me mad, chivying away all my better feelings 
with this silly tombstone nonsense of yours. Go away, and get 
somebody to bury you cheap, and I’ll pay half the expense.”

He was bewildered for a moment. He rubbed his eyes, and 
looked hard at me. I seemed human enough on the outside: he 
couldn’t make it out.

He said:
“Yuise a stranger in these parts? You don’t live here?”
“No,” I said, “I don’t. You wouldn’t if I did.”
“Well then,” he said, “you want to see the tombs — graves — 

folks been buried, you know — coffins!”

“You are an untruther,” I replied, getting roused; “I do not 
want to see tombs — not your tombs. Why should I? We have 
graves of our own, our family has. Why my uncle Podger has 
a tomb in Kensal Green Cemetery, that is the pride of all that 
country-side; and my grandfather’s vault at Bow is capable of 
accommodating eight visitors, while my great-aunt Susan has 
a brick grave in Finchley Churchyard, with a headstone with 
a coffee-pot sort of thing in bas-relief upon it, and a six-inch 
best white stone coping all the way round, that cost pounds. 
When I want graves, it is to those places that I go and revel. I 
do not want other folk’s. When you yourself are buried, I will 
come and see yours. That is all I can do for you.”

He burst into tears. He said that one of the tombs had a bit 
of stone upon the top of it that had been said by some to be 
probably part of the remains of the figure of a man, and that 
another had some words, carved upon it, that nobody had ever 
been able to decipher.

I still remained obdurate, and, in broken-hearted tones, he 

said:

“Well, won’t you come and see the memorial window?”
I would not even see that, so he fired his last shot. He drew 

near, and whispered hoarsely:

“I’ve  got  a  couple  of  skulls  down  in  the  crypt,”  he  said; 
“come and see those. Oh, do come and see the skulls! You are 

— 72 —

a young man out for a holiday, and you want to enjoy yourself. 
Come and see the skulls!”

Then I turned and fled, and as I sped I heard him calling to 

“Oh,  come  and  see  the  skulls;  come  back  and  see  the 

me:

skulls!”

Harris, however, revels in tombs, and graves, and epitaphs, 
and monumental inscriptions, and the thought of not seeing 
Mrs. Thomas’s grave made him crazy. He said he had looked 
forward to seeing Mrs. Thomas’s grave from the first moment 
that the trip was proposed — said he wouldn’t have joined if it 
hadn’t been for the idea of seeing Mrs. Thomas’s tomb.

I reminded him of George, and how we had to get the boat 
up to Shepperton by five o’clock to meet him, and then he went 
for George. Why was George to fool about all day, and leave us 
to  lug  this  lumbering  old  top-heavy  barge  up  and  down  the 
river  by  ourselves  to  meet  him? Why  couldn’t  George  come 
and do some work? Why couldn’t he have got the day off, and 
come down with us? Bank be blowed! What good was he at 
the bank?

“I never see him doing any work there,” continued Harris, 
“whenever I go in. He sits behind a bit of glass all day, trying to 
look as if he was doing something. What’s the good of a man 
behind a bit of glass? I have to work for my living. Why can’t he 
work. What use is he there, and what’s the good of their banks? 
They  take  your  money,  and  then,  when  you  draw  a  cheque, 
they send it back smeared all over with ‘No effects,’ ‘Refer to 
drawer.’ What’s the good of that? That’s the sort of trick they 
served  me  twice  last  week.  I’m  not  going  to  stand  it  much 
longer. I shall withdraw my account. If he was here, we could 
go and see that tomb. I don’t believe he’s at the bank at all. He’s 
larking about somewhere, that’s what he’s doing, leaving us to 
do all the work. I’m going to get out, and have a drink.”

I pointed out to him that we were miles away from a pub.; 
and then he went on about the river, and what was the good 

— 73 —

of the river, and was everyone who came on the river to die of 
thirst?

It is always best to let Harris have his head when he gets like 

this. Then he pumps himself out, and is quiet afterwards.

I  reminded  him  that  there  was  concentrated  lemonade  in 
the hamper, and a gallon-jar of water in the nose of the boat, 
and that the two only wanted mixing to make a cool and re-
freshing beverage.

Then he flew off about lemonade, and “such-like Sunday-
school slops,” as he termed them, ginger-beer, raspberry syrup, 
&c., &c. He said they all produced dyspepsia, and ruined body 
and soul alike, and were the cause of half the crime in Eng-
land.

He  said  he  must  drink  something,  however,  and  climbed 
upon the seat, and leant over to get the bottle. It was right at 
the bottom of the hamper, and seemed difficult to find, and 
he had to lean over further and further, and, in trying to steer 
at the same time, from a topsy-turvy point of view, he pulled 
the wrong line, and sent the boat into the bank, and the shock 
upset him, and he dived down right into the hamper, and stood 
there on his head, holding on to the sides of the boat like grim 
death, his legs sticking up into the air. He dared not move for 
fear of going over, and had to stay there till I could get hold of 
his legs, and haul him back, and that made him madder than 
ever.

CHAPTER VIII.

Blackmailing. — The proper course to pursue. — Selfish boorishness 
of river-side landowner. — “Notice” boards. — Unchristianlike feel-
ings  of  Harris. — How  Harris  sings  a  comic  song. — A  high-class 
party. — Shameful conduct of two abandoned young men. — Some 

useless information. — George buys a banjo.

WE stopped under the willows by Kempton Park, and lunched. 
It is a pretty little spot there: a pleasant grass plateau, running 
along by the water’s edge, and overhung by willows. We had 
just commenced the third course — the bread and jam — when 
a gentleman in shirt-sleeves and a short pipe came along, and 
wanted to know if we knew that we were trespassing. We said 
we hadn’t given the matter sufficient consideration as yet to 
enable us to arrive at a definite conclusion on that point, but 
that, if he assured us on his word as a gentleman that we were 
trespassing, we would, without further hesitation, believe it.

He gave us the required assurance, and we thanked him, but 
he still hung about, and seemed to be dissatisfied, so we asked 
him if there was anything further that we could do for him; 
and Harris, who is of a chummy disposition, offered him a bit 
of bread and jam.

I  fancy  he  must  have  belonged  to  some  society  sworn  to 
abstain from bread and jam; for he declined it quite gruffly, as 
if he were vexed at being tempted with it, and he added that it 
was his duty to turn us off.

Harris  said  that  if  it  was  a  duty  it  ought  to  be  done,  and 
asked the man what was his idea with regard to the best means 
for accomplishing it. Harris is what you would call a well-made 
man of about number one size, and looks hard and bony, and 
the man measured him up and down, and said he would go 
and consult his master, and then come back and chuck us both 
into the river.

Of course, we never saw him any more, and, of course, all he 
really wanted was a shilling. There are a certain number of riv-
erside roughs who make quite an income, during the summer, 

— 75 —

by slouching about the banks and blackmailing weak-minded 
noodles in this way. They represent themselves as sent by the 
proprietor. The proper course to pursue is to offer your name 
and address, and leave the owner, if he really has anything to 
do with the matter, to summon you, and prove what damage 
you have done to his land by sitting down on a bit of it. But the 
majority of people are so intensely lazy and timid, that they 
prefer  to  encourage  the  imposition  by  giving  in  to  it  rather 
than put an end to it by the exertion of a little firmness.

Where it is really the owners that are to blame, they ought to 
be shown up. The selfishness of the riparian proprietor grows 
with every year. If these men had their way they would close 
the river Thames altogether. They actually do this along the 
minor  tributary  streams  and  in  the  backwaters.  They  drive 
posts into the bed of the stream, and draw chains across from 
bank to bank, and nail huge notice-boards on every tree. The 
sight of those notice-boards rouses every evil instinct in my 
nature. I feel I want to tear each one down, and hammer it over 
the head of the man who put it up, until I have killed him, and 
then I would bury him, and put the board up over the grave as 
a tombstone.

I mentioned these feelings of mine to Harris, and he said he 
had them worse than that. He said he not only felt he wanted 
to kill the man who caused the board to be put up, but that 
he should like to slaughter the whole of his family and all his 
friends  and  relations,  and  then  burn  down  his  house.  This 
seemed to me to be going too far, and I said so to Harris; but 
he answered:

“Not a bit of it. Serve ’em all jolly well right, and I’d go and 

sing comic songs on the ruins.”

I was vexed to hear Harris go on in this blood-thirsty strain. 
We never ought to allow our instincts of justice to degenerate 
into  mere  vindictiveness.  It  was  a  long  while  before  I  could 
get Harris to take a more Christian view of the subject, but I 
succeeded at last, and he promised me that he would spare the 

— 76 —

friends and relations at all events, and would not sing comic 
songs on the ruins.

You  have  never  heard  Harris  sing  a  comic  song,  or  you 
would understand the service I had rendered to mankind. It 
is  one  of  Harris’s  fixed  ideas  that  he  can  sing  a  comic  song; 
the fixed idea, on the contrary, among those of Harris’s friends 
who have heard him try, is that he can’t and never will be able 
to, and that he ought not to be allowed to try.

When Harris is at a party, and is asked to sing, he replies: 
“Well, I can only sing a comic song, you know;” and he says 
it in a tone that implies that his singing of that, however, is a 
thing that you ought to hear once, and then die.

“Oh, that is nice,” says the hostess. “Do sing one, Mr. Harris;” 
and Harris gets up, and makes for the piano, with the beaming 
cheeriness of a generous-minded man who is just about to give 
somebody something.

“Now, silence, please, everybody” says the hostess, turning 

round; “Mr. Harris is going to sing a comic song!”

“Oh, how jolly!” they murmur; and they hurry in from the 
conservatory, and come up from the stairs, and go and fetch 
each other from all over the house, and crowd into the draw-
ing-room, and sit round, all smirking in anticipation.

Then Harris begins.
Well, you don’t look for much of a voice in a comic song. You 
don’t expect correct phrasing or vocalization. You don’t mind 
if a man does find out, when in the middle of a note, that he is 
too high, and comes down with a jerk. You don’t bother about 
time. You don’t mind a man being two bars in front of the ac-
companiment, and easing up in the middle of a line to argue it 
out with the pianist, and then starting the verse afresh. But you 
do expect the words.

You don’t expect a man to never remember more than the 
first  three  lines  of  the  first  verse,  and  to  keep  on  repeating 
these until it is time to begin the chorus. You don’t expect a 
man to break off in the middle of a line, and snigger, and say, 
it’s very funny, but he’s blest if he can think of the rest of it, and 

— 77 —

then try and make it up for himself, and, afterwards, suddenly 
recollect it, when he has got to an entirely different part of the 
song, and break off, without a word of warning, to go back and 
let you have it then and there. You don’t — well, I will just give 
you an idea of Harris’s comic singing, and then you can judge 
of it for yourself.

HARRIS (standing up in front of piano and addressing the ex-
pectant mob): “I’m afraid it’s a very old thing, you know. I ex-
pect you all know it, you know. But it’s the only thing I know. 
It’s the Judge’s song out of Pinafore — no, I don’t mean Pina-
fore — I mean — you know what I mean — the other thing, 
you know. You must all join in the chorus, you know.”

  Murmurs of delight and anxiety to join in the chorus. Bril-
liant performance of prelude to the Judge’s song in “Trial by 
Jury” by nervous Pianist. Moment arrives for Harris to join 
in. Harris takes no notice of it. Nervous pianist commences 
prelude  over  again,  and  Harris,  commencing  singing  at  the 
same  time,  dashes  off  the  first  two  lines  of  the  First  Lord’s 
song out of “Pinafore.” Nervous pianist tries to push on with 
prelude, gives it up, and tries to follow Harris with accompa-
niment to Judge’s song out “Trial by Jury,” finds that doesn’t 
answer, and tries to recollect what he is doing, and where he 
is, feels his mind giving way, and stops short.

HARRIS (with kindly encouragement): “It’s all right. You’re do-

ing it very well, indeed — go on.”

NERVOUS PIANIST: “I’m afraid there’s a mistake somewhere. 

HARRIS (promptly): “Why the Judge’s song out of Trial by Jury. 

What are you singing?”

Don’t you know it?”

SOME FRIEND OF HARRIS’S (from the back of the room): “No, 
you’re  not,  you  chuckle-head,  you’re  singing  the Admiral’s 
song from Pinafore.”

  Long argument between Harris and Harris’s friend as to what 
Harris is really singing. Friend finally suggests that it doesn’t 
matter what Harris is singing so long as Harris gets on and 

— 78 —

sings it, and Harris, with an evident sense of injustice rankling 
inside him, requests pianist to begin again. Pianist, thereupon, 
starts prelude to the Admiral’s song, and Harris, seizing what 
he considers to be a favourable opening in the music, begins.

HARRIS:

“‘When I was young and called to the Bar.’”

  General  roar  of  laughter,  taken  by  Harris  as  a  compliment. 
Pianist, thinking of his wife and family, gives up the unequal 
contest and retires; his place being taken by a stronger-nerved 
man.

THE NEW PIANIST (cheerily): “Now then, old man, you start 

off, and I’ll follow. We won’t bother about any prelude.”

HARRIS  (upon  whom  the  explanation  of  matters  has  slowly 
dawned  —  laughing):  “By  Jove!  I  beg  your  pardon.  Of 
course — I’ve been mixing up the two songs. It was Jenkins 
who confused me, you know. Now then.

  Singing; his voice appearing to come from the cellar, and sug-
gesting the first low warnings of an approaching earthquake.

“‘When I was young I served a term
As office-boy to an attorney’s firm.’

 

(Aside to pianist): “It is too low, old man; we’ll have that over 
again, if you don’t mind.”

  Sings first two lines over again, in a high falsetto this time. 
Great surprise on the part of the audience. Nervous old lady 
near the fire begins to cry, and has to be led out.

HARRIS (continuing):

“I swept the windows and I swept the door,
And I — ’

  No — no, I cleaned the windows of the big front door. And 
I polished up the floor — no, dash it — I beg your pardon — 
funny thing, I can’t think of that line. And I — and I — Oh, 
well, we’ll get on to the chorus, and chance it (sings):

‘And I diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-de,
Till now I am the ruler of the Queen’s navee.’

  Now  then,  chorus — it  is  the  last  two  lines  repeated,  you 

know.

— 79 —

GENERAL CHORUS:

‘And he diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-dee’d,
Till now he is the ruler of the Queen’s navee.’

And Harris never sees what an ass he is making of himself, 
and how he is annoying a lot of people who never did him any 
harm. He honestly imagines that he has given them a treat, and 
says he will sing another comic song after supper.

Speaking of comic songs and parties, reminds me of a rather 
curious incident at which I once assisted; which, as it throws 
much light upon the inner mental working of human nature in 
general, ought, I think, to be recorded in these pages.

We  were  a  fashionable  and  highly  cultured  party. We  had 
on  our  best  clothes,  and  we  talked  pretty,  and  were  very 
happy — all except two young fellows, students, just returned 
from Germany, commonplace young men, who seemed rest-
less and uncomfortable, as if they found the proceedings slow. 
The truth was, we were too clever for them. Our brilliant but 
polished conversation, and our high-class tastes, were beyond 
them. They were out of place, among us. They never ought to 
have been there at all. Everybody agreed upon that, later on.

We played morceaux from the old German masters. We dis-
cussed philosophy and ethics. We flirted with graceful dignity. 
We were even humorous — in a high-class way.

Somebody recited a French poem after supper, and we said 
it was beautiful; and then a lady sang a sentimental ballad in 
Spanish,  and  it  made  one  or  two  of  us  weep — it  was  so  pa-
thetic.

And then those two young men got up, and asked us if we 
had ever heard Herr Slossenn Boschen (who had just arrived, 
and was then down in the supper-room) sing his great German 
comic song.

None of us had heard it, that we could remember.
The young men said it was the funniest song that had ever 
been written, and that, if we liked, they would get Herr Slos-
senn Boschen, whom they knew very well, to sing it. They said 

— 80 —

it was so funny that, when Herr Slossenn Boschen had sung it 
once before the German Emperor, he (the German Emperor) 
had had to be carried off to bed.

They said nobody could sing it like Herr Slossenn Boschen; 
he was so intensely serious all through it that you might fancy 
he was reciting a tragedy, and that, of course, made it all the 
funnier. They said he never once suggested by his tone or man-
ner that he was singing anything funny — that would spoil it. 
It was his air of seriousness, almost of pathos, that made it so 
irresistibly amusing.

We  said  we  yearned  to  hear  it,  that  we  wanted  a  good 
laugh; and they went downstairs, and fetched Herr Slossenn 
Boschen.

He appeared to be quite pleased to sing it, for he came up at 

once, and sat down to the piano without another word.

“Oh, it will amuse you. You will laugh,” whispered the two 
young men, as they passed through the room, and took up an 
unobtrusive position behind the Professor’s back.

Herr Slossenn Boschen accompanied himself. The prelude 
did not suggest a comic song exactly. It was a weird, soulful 
air. It quite made one’s flesh creep; but we murmured to one 
another that it was the German method, and prepared to enjoy 
it.

I don’t understand German myself. I learned it at school, but 
forgot every word of it two years after I had left, and have felt 
much better ever since. Still, I did not want the people there to 
guess my ignorance; so I hit upon what I thought to be rather 
a good idea. I kept my eye on the two young students, and fol-
lowed them. When they tittered, I tittered; when they roared, 
I roared; and I also threw in a little snigger all by myself now 
and then, as if I had seen a bit of humour that had escaped the 
others. I considered this particularly artful on my part.

I noticed, as the song progressed, that a good many other 
people seemed to have their eye fixed on the two young men, 
as  well  as  myself.  These  other  people  also  tittered  when  the 
young men tittered, and roared when the young men roared; 

— 81 —

and, as the two young men tittered and roared and exploded 
with laughter pretty continuously all through the song, it went 
exceedingly well.

And yet that German Professor did not seem happy. At first, 
when we began to laugh, the expression of his face was one of 
intense surprise, as if laughter were the very last thing he had 
expected to be greeted with. We thought this very funny: we 
said  his  earnest  manner  was  half  the  humour.  The  slightest 
hint on his part that he knew how funny he was would have 
completely ruined it all. As we continued to laugh, his surprise 
gave  way  to  an  air  of  annoyance  and  indignation,  and  he 
scowled fiercely round upon us all (except upon the two young 
men who, being behind him, he could not see). That sent us 
into convulsions. We told each other that it would be the death 
of  us,  this  thing.  The  words  alone,  we  said,  were  enough  to 
send  us  into  fits,  but  added  to  his  mock  seriousness — oh,  it 
was too much!

In the last verse, he surpassed himself. He glowered round 
upon us with a look of such concentrated ferocity that, but for 
our being forewarned as to the German method of comic sing-
ing, we should have been nervous; and he threw such a wailing 
note of agony into the weird music that, if we had not known 
it was a funny song, we might have wept.

He finished amid a perfect shriek of laughter. We said it was 
the funniest thing we had ever heard in all our lives. We said 
how strange it was that, in the face of things like these, there 
should be a popular notion that the Germans hadn’t any sense 
of humour. And we asked the Professor why he didn’t translate 
the song into English, so that the common people could un-
derstand it, and hear what a real comic song was like.

Then Herr Slossenn Boschen got up, and went on awful. He 
swore at us in German (which I should judge to be a singularly 
effective language for that purpose), and he danced, and shook 
his fists, and called us all the English he knew. He said he had 
never been so insulted in all his life.

It appeared that the song was not a comic song at all. It was 

— 82 —

about a young girl who lived in the Hartz Mountains, and who 
had given up her life to save her lover’s soul; and he died, and 
met her spirit in the air; and then, in the last verse, he jilted 
her  spirit,  and  went  on  with  another  spirit — I’m  not  quite 
sure of the details, but it was something very sad, I know. Herr 
Boschen said he had sung it once before the German Emperor, 
and he (the German Emperor) had sobbed like a little child. 
He (Herr Boschen) said it was generally acknowledged to be 
one of the most tragic and pathetic songs in the German lan-
guage.

It was a trying situation for us — very trying. There seemed 
to  be  no  answer. We  looked  around  for  the  two  young  men 
who had done this thing, but they had left the house in an un-
ostentatious manner immediately after the end of the song.

That was the end of that party. I never saw a party break up 
so  quietly,  and  with  so  little  fuss. We  never  said  good-night 
even to one another. We came downstairs one at a time, walk-
ing  softly,  and  keeping  the  shady  side. We  asked  the  servant 
for our hats and coats in whispers, and opened the door for 
ourselves, and slipped out, and got round the corner quickly, 
avoiding each other as much as possible.

I  have  never  taken  much  interest  in  German  songs  since 

then.

We  reached  Sunbury  Lock  at  half-past  three.  The  river  is 
sweetly pretty just there before you come to the gates, and the 
backwater is charming; but don’t attempt to row up it.

I tried to do so once. I was sculling, and asked the fellows 
who were steering if they thought it could be done, and they 
said, oh, yes, they thought so, if I pulled hard. We were just un-
der the little foot-bridge that crosses it between the two weirs, 
when they said this, and I bent down over the sculls, and set 
myself up, and pulled.

I pulled splendidly. I got well into a steady rhythmical swing. 
I put my arms, and my legs, and my back into it. I set myself a 
good, quick, dashing stroke, and worked in really grand style. 
My two friends said it was a pleasure to watch me. At the end 

— 83 —

of five minutes, I thought we ought to be pretty near the weir, 
and  I  looked  up.  We  were  under  the  bridge,  in  exactly  the 
same spot that we were when I began, and there were those 
two idiots, injuring themselves by violent laughing. I had been 
grinding away like mad to keep that boat stuck still under that 
bridge.  I  let  other  people  pull  up  backwaters  against  strong 
streams now.

We sculled up to Walton, a rather large place for a riverside 
town. As with all riverside places, only the tiniest corner of it 
comes down to the water, so that from the boat you might fan-
cy it was a village of some half-dozen houses, all told. Windsor 
and Abingdon are the only towns between London and Oxford 
that  you  can  really  see  anything  of  from  the  stream. All  the 
others hide round corners, and merely peep at the river down 
one  street:  my  thanks  to  them  for  being  so  considerate,  and 
leaving the river-banks to woods and fields and water-works.

Even Reading, though it does its best to spoil and sully and 
make hideous as much of the river as it can reach, is good-na-
tured enough to keep its ugly face a good deal out of sight.

Cæsar,  of  course,  had  a  little  place  at  Walton — a  camp, 
or an entrenchment, or something of that sort. Cæsar was a 
regular  up-river  man.  Also  Queen  Elizabeth,  she  was  there, 
too. You can never get away from that woman, go where you 
will. Cromwell and Bradshaw (not the guide man, but the King 
Charles’s head man) likewise sojourned here. They must have 
been quite a pleasant little party, altogether.

There  is  an  iron “scold’s  bridle”  in  Walton  Church.  They 
used these things in ancient days for curbing women’s tongues. 
They have given up the attempt now. I suppose iron was get-
ting scarce, and nothing else would be strong enough.

There are also tombs of note in the church, and I was afraid 
I  should  never  get  Harris  past  them;  but  he  didn’t  seem  to 
think  of  them,  and  we  went  on.  Above  the  bridge  the  river 
winds tremendously. This makes it look picturesque; but it ir-
ritates you from a towing or sculling point of view, and causes 

— 84 —

argument between the man who is pulling and the man who 
is steering.

You pass Oatlands Park on the right bank here. It is a famous 
old place. Henry VIII. stole it from some one or the other, I 
forget whom now, and lived in it. There is a grotto in the park 
which you can see for a fee, and which is supposed to be very 
wonderful; but I cannot see much in it myself. The late Duch-
ess of York, who lived at Oatlands, was very fond of dogs, and 
kept an immense number. She had a special graveyard made, 
in  which  to  bury  them  when  they  died,  and  there  they  lie, 
about fifty of them, with a tombstone over each, and an epi-
taph inscribed thereon.

Well, I dare say they deserve it quite as much as the average 

Christian does.

At “Corway Stakes” — the first bend above Walton Bridge — 
was fought a battle between Cæsar and Cassivelaunus. Cassive-
launus had prepared the river for Cæsar, by planting it full of 
stakes (and had, no doubt, put up a notice-board). But Cæsar 
crossed in spite of this. You couldn’t choke Cæsar off that river. 
He is the sort of man we want round the backwaters now.

Halliford and Shepperton are both pretty little spots where 
they  touch  the  river;  but  there  is  nothing  remarkable  about 
either  of  them.  There  is  a  tomb  in  Shepperton  churchyard, 
however,  with  a  poem  on  it,  and  I  was  nervous  lest  Harris 
should want to get out and fool round it. I saw him fix a long-
ing eye on the landing-stage as we drew near it, so I managed, 
by an adroit movement, to jerk his cap into the water, and in 
the excitement of recovering that, and his indignation at my 
clumsiness, he forgot all about his beloved graves.

At Weybridge, the Wey (a pretty little stream, navigable for 
small boats up to Guildford, and one which I have always been 
making up my mind to explore, and never have), the Bourne, 
and the Basingstoke Canal all enter the Thames together. The 
lock is just opposite the town, and the first thing that we saw, 
when we came in view of it, was George’s blazer on one of the 
lock gates, closer inspection showing that George was inside it.

— 85 —

Montmorency  set  up  a  furious  barking,  I  shrieked,  Harris 
roared;  George  waved  his  hat,  and  yelled  back.  The  lock-
keeper  rushed  out  with  a  drag,  under  the  impression  that 
somebody had fallen into the lock, and appeared annoyed at 
finding that no one had.

George  had  rather  a  curious  oilskin-covered  parcel  in  his 
hand.  It  was  round  and  flat  at  one  end,  with  a  long  straight 
handle sticking out of it.

“What’s that?” said Harris — “a frying-pan?”
“No,” said George, with a strange, wild look glittering in his 
eyes; “they are all the rage this season; everybody has got them 
up the river. It’s a banjo.”

“I never knew you played the banjo!” cried Harris and I, in 

one breath.

“Not  exactly,”  replied  George: “but  it’s  very  easy,  they  tell 

me; and I’ve got the instruction book!”

— 86 —

CHAPTER IX.

George  is  introduced  to  work. — Heathenish  instincts  of  tow-
lines. — Ungrateful  conduct  of  a  double-sculling  skiff. — Towers 
and  towed. — A  use  discovered  for  lovers. — Strange  disappear-
ance of an elderly lady. — Much haste, less speed. — Being towed 
by  girls:  exciting  sensation. — The  missing  lock  or  the  haunted 

river. — Music. — Saved!

WE made George work, now we had got him. He did not want 
to work, of course; that goes without saying. He had had a hard 
time in the City, so he explained. Harris, who is callous in his 
nature, and not prone to pity, said:

“Ah! and now you are going to have a hard time on the river 

for a change; change is good for everyone. Out you get!”

He  could  not  in  conscience — not  even  George’s  con-
science — object, though he did suggest that, perhaps, it would 
be better for him to stop in the boat, and get tea ready, while 
Harris and I towed, because getting tea was such a worrying 
work, and Harris and I looked tired. The only reply we made 
to this, however, was to pass him over the tow-line, and he took 
it, and stepped out.

There is something very strange and unaccountable about a 
tow-line. You roll it up with as much patience and care as you 
would take to fold up a new pair of trousers, and five minutes 
afterwards, when you pick it up, it is one ghastly, soul-revolt-
ing tangle.

I do not wish to be insulting, but I firmly believe that if you 
took an average tow-line, and stretched it out straight across 
the middle of a field, and then turned your back on it for thirty 
seconds, that, when you looked round again, you would find 
that it had got itself altogether in a heap in the middle of the 
field, and had twisted itself up, and tied itself into knots, and 
lost its two ends, and become all loops; and it would take you 
a good half-hour, sitting down there on the grass and swearing 
all the while, to disentangle it again.

That is my opinion of tow-lines in general. Of course, there 
may  be  honourable  exceptions;  I  do  not  say  that  there  are 

— 87 —

not. There may be tow-lines that are a credit to their profes-
sion — conscientious, respectable tow-lines — tow-lines that do 
not imagine they are crochet-work, and try to knit themselves 
up into antimacassars the instant they are left to themselves. I 
say there may be such tow-lines; I sincerely hope there are. But 
I have not met with them.

This tow-line I had taken in myself just before we had got 
to the lock. I would not let Harris touch it, because he is care-
less. I had looped it round slowly and cautiously, and tied it 
up in the middle, and folded it in two, and laid it down gently 
at the bottom of the boat. Harris had lifted it up scientifically, 
and had put it into George’s hand. George had taken it firmly, 
and held it away from him, and had begun to unravel it as if he 
were taking the swaddling clothes off a new-born infant; and, 
before he had unwound a dozen yards, the thing was more like 
a badly-made door-mat than anything else.

It is always the same, and the same sort of thing always goes 
on in connection with it. The man on the bank, who is trying 
to  disentangle  it,  thinks  all  the  fault  lies  with  the  man  who 
rolled it up; and when a man up the river thinks a thing, he 
says it.

“What have you been trying to do with it, make a fishing-
net of it? You’ve made a nice mess you have; why couldn’t you 
wind it up properly, you silly dummy?” he grunts from time to 
time as he struggles wildly with it, and lays it out flat on the 
tow-path, and runs round and round it, trying to find the end.
On  the  other  hand,  the  man  who  wound  it  up  thinks  the 
whole cause of the muddle rests with the man who is trying 
to unwind it.

“It was all right when you took it!” he exclaims indignantly. 
“Why don’t you think what you are doing? You go about things 
in such a slap-dash style. You’d get a scaffolding pole entangled 
you would!”

And  they  feel  so  angry  with  one  another  that  they  would 

like to hang each other with the thing.

Ten minutes go by, and the first man gives a yell and goes 

— 88 —

mad, and dances on the rope, and tries to pull it straight by 
seizing hold of the first piece that comes to his hand and haul-
ing at it. Of course, this only gets it into a tighter tangle than 
ever. Then the second man climbs out of the boat and comes 
to help him, and they get in each other’s way, and hinder one 
another. They both get hold of the same bit of line, and pull at 
it in opposite directions, and wonder where it is caught. In the 
end, they do get it clear, and then turn round and find that the 
boat has drifted off, and is making straight for the weir.

This really happened once to my own knowledge. It was up 
by Boveney, one rather windy morning. We were pulling down 
stream, and, as we came round the bend, we noticed a couple 
of  men  on  the  bank.  They  were  looking  at  each  other  with 
as bewildered and helplessly miserable expressions as I have 
ever  witnessed  on  any  human  countenance  before  or  since, 
and they held a long tow-line between them. It was clear that 
something had happened, so we eased up and asked them what 
was the matter.

“Why,  our  boat’s  gone  off!”  they  replied  in  an  indignant 
tone. “We just got out to disentangle the tow-line, and when 
we looked round, it was gone!”

And they seemed hurt at what they evidently regarded as a 

mean and ungrateful act on the part of the boat.

We found the truant for them half a mile further down, held 
by some rushes, and we brought it back to them. I bet they did 
not give that boat another chance for a week.

I shall never forget the picture of those two men walking up 

and down the bank with a tow-line, looking for their boat.

One sees a good many funny incidents up the river in con-
nection with towing. One of the most common is the sight of 
a couple of towers, walking briskly along, deep in an animated 
discussion, while the man in the boat, a hundred yards behind 
them, is vainly shrieking to them to stop, and making frantic 
signs of distress with a scull. Something has gone wrong; the 
rudder has come off, or the boat-hook has slipped overboard, 

— 89 —

or his hat has dropped into the water and is floating rapidly 
down stream.

He calls to them to stop, quite gently and politely at first.
“Hi!  stop  a  minute,  will  you?”  he  shouts  cheerily.  “I’ve 

dropped my hat over-board.”

Then: “Hi!  Tom — Dick!  can’t  you  hear?”  not  quite  so  af-

Then: “Hi! Confound you, you dunder-headed idiots! Hi! 

fably this time.

stop! Oh you — !”

After that he springs up, and dances about, and roars him-
self red in the face, and curses everything he knows. And the 
small boys on the bank stop and jeer at him, and pitch stones 
at him as he is pulled along past them, at the rate of four miles 
an hour, and can’t get out.

Much of this sort of trouble would be saved if those who 
are towing would keep remembering that they are towing, and 
give a pretty frequent look round to see how their man is get-
ting on. It is best to let one person tow. When two are doing it, 
they get chattering, and forget, and the boat itself, offering, as 
it does, but little resistance, is of no real service in reminding 
them of the fact.

As an example of how utterly oblivious a pair of towers can 
be to their work, George told us, later on in the evening, when 
we were discussing the subject after supper, of a very curious 
instance.

He  and  three  other  men,  so  he  said,  were  sculling  a  very 
heavily laden boat up from Maidenhead one evening, and a lit-
tle above Cookham lock they noticed a fellow and a girl, walk-
ing along the towpath, both deep in an apparently interesting 
and absorbing conversation. They were carrying a boat-hook 
between them, and, attached to the boat-hook was a tow-line, 
which trailed behind them, its end in the water. No boat was 
near,  no  boat  was  in  sight.  There  must  have  been  a  boat  at-
tached to that tow-line at some time or other, that was certain; 
but what had become of it, what ghastly fate had overtaken it, 
and those who had been left in it, was buried in mystery. What-

— 90 —

ever the accident may have been, however, it had in no way dis-
turbed the young lady and gentleman, who were towing. They 
had the boat-hook and they had the line, and that seemed to be 
all that they thought necessary to their work.

George was about to call out and wake them up, but, at that 
moment, a bright idea flashed across him, and he didn’t. He 
got the hitcher instead, and reached over, and drew in the end 
of  the  tow-line;  and  they  made  a  loop  in  it,  and  put  it  over 
their mast, and then they tidied up the sculls, and went and sat 
down in the stern, and lit their pipes.

And that young man and young woman towed those four 

hulking chaps and a heavy boat up to Marlow.

George  said  he  never  saw  so  much  thoughtful  sadness 
concentrated into one glance before, as when, at the lock, that 
young couple grasped the idea that, for the last two miles, they 
had been towing the wrong boat. George fancied that, if it had 
not been for the restraining influence of the sweet woman at 
his side, the young man might have given way to violent lan-
guage.

The maiden was the first to recover from her surprise, and, 

when she did, she clasped her hands, and said, wildly:

“Oh, Henry, then where is auntie?”
“Did they ever recover the old lady?” asked Harris.
George replied he did not know.
Another  example  of  the  dangerous  want  of  sympathy  be-
tween tower and towed was witnessed by George and myself 
once up near Walton. It was where the tow-path shelves gently 
down  into  the  water,  and  we  were  camping  on  the  opposite 
bank, noticing things in general. By-and-by a small boat came 
in sight, towed through the water at a tremendous pace by a 
powerful barge horse, on which sat a very small boy. Scattered 
about the boat, in dreamy and reposeful attitudes, lay five fel-
lows, the man who was steering having a particularly restful 
appearance.

“I  should  like  to  see  him  pull  the  wrong  line,”  murmured 
George, as they passed. And at that precise moment the man 

— 91 —

did it, and the boat rushed up the bank with a noise like the 
ripping up of forty thousand linen sheets. Two men, a hamper, 
and three oars immediately left the boat on the larboard side, 
and reclined on the bank, and one and a half moments after-
wards,  two  other  men  disembarked  from  the  starboard,  and 
sat  down  among  boat-hooks  and  sails  and  carpet-bags  and 
bottles. The last man went on twenty yards further, and then 
got out on his head.

This seemed to sort of lighten the boat, and it went on much 
easier, the small boy shouting at the top of his voice, and urg-
ing his steed into a gallop. The fellows sat up and stared at one 
another.  It  was  some  seconds  before  they  realised  what  had 
happened  to  them,  but,  when  they  did,  they  began  to  shout 
lustily for the boy to stop. He, however, was too much occupied 
with the horse to hear them, and we watched them, flying after 
him, until the distance hid them from view.

I  cannot  say  I  was  sorry  at  their  mishap.  Indeed,  I  only 
wish  that  all  the  young  fools  who  have  their  boats  towed  in 
this fashion — and plenty do — could meet with similar mis-
fortunes.  Besides  the  risk  they  run  themselves,  they  become 
a  danger  and  an  annoyance  to  every  other  boat  they  pass. 
Going at the pace they do, it is impossible for them to get out 
of anybody else’s way, or for anybody else to get out of theirs. 
Their line gets hitched across your mast, and overturns you, or 
it catches somebody in the boat, and either throws them into 
the water, or cuts their face open. The best plan is to stand your 
ground, and be prepared to keep them off with the butt-end 
of a mast.

Of  all  experiences  in  connection  with  towing,  the  most 
exciting is being towed by girls. It is a sensation that nobody 
ought to miss. It takes three girls to tow always; two hold the 
rope,  and  the  other  one  runs  round  and  round,  and  giggles. 
They generally begin by getting themselves tied up. They get 
the line round their legs, and have to sit down on the path and 
undo each other, and then they twist it round their necks, and 
are nearly strangled. They fix it straight, however, at last, and 

— 92 —

start off at a run, pulling the boat along at quite a dangerous 
pace. At the end of a hundred yards they are naturally breath-
less, and suddenly stop, and all sit down on the grass and laugh, 
and your boat drifts out to mid-stream and turns round, be-
fore you know what has happened, or can get hold of a scull. 
Then they stand up, and are surprised.

“Oh, look!” they say; “he’s gone right out into the middle.”
They pull on pretty steadily for a bit, after this, and then it 
all at once occurs to one of them that she will pin up her frock, 
and they ease up for the purpose, and the boat runs aground.
You jump up, and push it off, and you shout to them not to 

stop.

stop.”

“Yes. What’s the matter?” they shout back.
“Don’t stop,” you roar.
“Don’t what?”
“Don’t stop — go on — go on!”
“Go back, Emily, and see what it is they want,” says one; and 

Emily comes back, and asks what it is.

“What do you want?” she says; “anything happened?”
“No,” you reply, “it’s all right; only go on, you know — don’t 

“Why not?”
“Why, we can’t steer, if you keep stopping. You must keep 

some way on the boat.”
“Keep some what?”
“Some way — you must keep the boat moving.”
“Oh, all right, I’ll tell ’em. Are we doing it all right?”
“Oh, yes, very nicely, indeed, only don’t stop.”
“It doesn’t seem difficult at all. I thought it was so hard.”
“Oh, no, it’s simple enough. You want to keep on steady at 

it, that’s all.”

“I see. Give me out my red shawl, it’s under the cushion.”
You  find  the  shawl,  and  hand  it  out,  and  by  this  time  an-
other  one  has  come  back  and  thinks  she  will  have  hers  too, 
and they take Mary’s on chance, and Mary does not want it, so 
they bring it back and have a pocket-comb instead. It is about 

— 93 —

twenty minutes before they get off again, and, at the next cor-
ner, they see a cow, and you have to leave the boat to chivy the 
cow out of their way.

There  is  never  a  dull  moment  in  the  boat  while  girls  are 

towing it.

George got the line right after a while, and towed us steadily 
on to Penton Hook. There we discussed the important question 
of camping. We had decided to sleep on board that night, and 
we had either to lay up just about there, or go on past Staines. 
It seemed early to think about shutting up then, however, with 
the sun still in the heavens, and we settled to push straight on 
for Runnymead, three and a half miles further, a quiet wooded 
part of the river, and where there is good shelter.

We all wished, however, afterward that we had stopped at 
Penton Hook. Three or four miles up stream is a trifle, early in 
the morning, but it is a weary pull at the end of a long day. You 
take no interest in the scenery during these last few miles. You 
do not chat and laugh. Every half-mile you cover seems like 
two. You can hardly believe you are only where you are, and 
you are convinced that the map must be wrong; and, when you 
have trudged along for what seems to you at least ten miles, 
and still the lock is not in sight, you begin to seriously fear that 
somebody must have sneaked it, and run off with it.

I  remember  being  terribly  upset  once  up  the  river  (in  a 
figurative sense, I mean). I was out with a young lady — cousin 
on my mother’s side — and we were pulling down to Goring. 
It was rather late, and we were anxious to get in — at least she 
was  anxious  to  get  in.  It  was  half-past  six  when  we  reached 
Benson’s lock, and dusk was drawing on, and she began to get 
excited then. She said she must be in to supper. I said it was a 
thing I felt I wanted to be in at, too; and I drew out a map I had 
with me to see exactly how far it was. I saw it was just a mile 
and a half to the next lock — Wallingford — and five on from 
there to Cleeve.

“Oh,  it’s  all  right!”  I  said. “We’ll  be  through  the  next  lock 

— 94 —

before seven, and then there is only one more;” and I settled 
down and pulled steadily away.

We passed the bridge, and soon after that I asked if she saw 
the lock. She said no, she did not see any lock; and I said, “Oh!” 
and pulled on. Another five minutes went by, and then I asked 
her to look again.

“No,” she said; “I can’t see any signs of a lock.”
“You — you are sure you know a lock, when you do see one?” 

I asked hesitatingly, not wishing to offend her.

The  question  did  offend  her,  however,  and  she  suggested 
that I had better look for myself; so I laid down the sculls, and 
took a view. The river stretched out straight before us in the 
twilight for about a mile; not a ghost of a lock was to be seen.
“You don’t think we have lost our way, do you?” asked my 

companion.

I did not see how that was possible; though, as I suggested, 
we might have somehow got into the weir stream, and be mak-
ing for the falls.

This  idea  did  not  comfort  her  in  the  least,  and  she  began 
to cry. She said we should both be drowned, and that it was a 
judgment on her for coming out with me.

It seemed an excessive punishment, I thought; but my cous-

in thought not, and hoped it would all soon be over.

I tried to reassure her, and to make light of the whole affair. 
I said that the fact evidently was that I was not rowing as fast 
as I fancied I was, but that we should soon reach the lock now; 
and I pulled on for another mile.

Then I began to get nervous myself. I looked again at the 
map. There was Wallingford lock, clearly marked, a mile and a 
half below Benson’s. It was a good, reliable map; and, besides, I 
recollected the lock myself. I had been through it twice. Where 
were we? What had happened to us? I began to think it must 
be all a dream, and that I was really asleep in bed, and should 
wake up in a minute, and be told it was past ten.

I asked my cousin if she thought it could be a dream, and 
she replied that she was just about to ask me the same ques-

— 95 —

tion; and then we both wondered if we were both asleep, and if 
so, who was the real one that was dreaming, and who was the 
one that was only a dream; it got quite interesting.

I  still  went  on  pulling,  however,  and  still  no  lock  came  in 
sight, and the river grew more and more gloomy and mysteri-
ous under the gathering shadows of night, and things seemed 
to be getting weird and uncanny. I thought of hobgoblins and 
banshees,  and  will-o’-the-wisps,  and  those  wicked  girls  who 
sit up all night on rocks, and lure people into whirl-pools and 
things; and I wished I had been a better man, and knew more 
hymns; and in the middle of these reflections I heard the bless-
ed strains of “He’s got ’em on,” played, badly, on a concertina, 
and knew that we were saved.

I do not admire the tones of a concertina, as a rule; but, oh! 
how beautiful the music seemed to us both then — far, far more 
beautiful than the voice of Orpheus or the lute of Apollo, or 
anything of that sort could have sounded. Heavenly melody, in 
our then state of mind, would only have still further harrowed 
us. A soul-moving harmony, correctly performed, we should 
have taken as a spirit-warning, and have given up all hope. But 
about  the  strains  of “He’s  got ’em  on,”  jerked  spasmodically, 
and  with  involuntary  variations,  out  of  a  wheezy  accordion, 
there was something singularly human and reassuring.

The  sweet  sounds  drew  nearer,  and  soon  the  boat  from 

which they were worked lay alongside us.

It contained a party of provincial ’Arrys and ’Arriets, out for 
a moonlight sail. (There was not any moon, but that was not 
their fault.) I never saw more attractive, lovable people in all 
my life. I hailed them, and asked if they could tell me the way 
to Wallingford lock; and I explained that I had been looking 
for it for the last two hours.

“Wallingford lock!” they answered. “Lor’ love you, sir, that’s 
been done away with for over a year. There ain’t no Walling-
ford lock now, sir. You’re close to Cleeve now. Blow me tight if 
’ere ain’t a gentleman been looking for Wallingford lock, Bill!”
I had never thought of that. I wanted to fall upon all their 

— 96 —

necks and bless them; but the stream was running too strong 
just there to allow of this, so I had to content myself with mere 
cold-sounding words of gratitude.

We thanked them over and over again, and we said it was a 
lovely night, and we wished them a pleasant trip, and, I think, 
I invited them all to come and spend a week with me, and my 
cousin said her mother would be so pleased to see them. And 
we sang the soldiers’ chorus out of Faust, and got home in time 
for supper, after all.

CHAPTER X.

Our first night. — Under canvas. — An appeal for help. — Contrari-
ness of tea-kettles, how to overcome. — Supper. — How to feel vir-
tuous. — Wanted!  A  comfortably-appointed,  well-drained  desert 
island, neighbourhood of South Pacific Ocean preferred. — Funny 

thing that happened to George’s father. — A restless night.

HARRIS and I began to think that Bell Weir lock must have 
been  done  away  with  after  the  same  manner.  George  had 
towed us up to Staines, and we had taken the boat from there, 
and it seemed that we were dragging fifty tons after us, and 
were walking forty miles. It was half-past seven when we were 
through, and we all got in, and sculled up close to the left bank, 
looking out for a spot to haul up in.

We had originally intended to go on to Magna Charta Island, 
a sweetly pretty part of the river, where it winds through a soft, 
green valley, and to camp in one of the many picturesque inlets 
to be found round that tiny shore. But, somehow, we did not 
feel that we yearned for the picturesque nearly so much now as 
we had earlier in the day. A bit of water between a coal-barge 
and a gas-works would have quite satisfied us for that night. 
We did not want scenery. We wanted to have our supper and go 
to bed. However, we did pull up to the point — “Picnic Point,” 
it is called — and dropped into a very pleasant nook under a 
great elm-tree, to the spreading roots of which we fastened the 
boat.

Then we thought we were going to have supper (we had dis-
pensed with tea, so as to save time), but George said no; that 
we had better get the canvas up first, before it got quite dark, 
and while we could see what we were doing. Then, he said, all 
our work would be done, and we could sit down to eat with an 
easy mind.

That canvas wanted more putting up than I think any of us 
had bargained for. It looked so simple in the abstract. You took 
five iron arches, like gigantic croquet hoops, and fitted them 

— 98 —

up over the boat, and then stretched the canvas over them, and 
fastened it down: it would take quite ten minutes, we thought.

That was an under-estimate.
We  took  up  the  hoops,  and  began  to  drop  them  into  the 
sockets  placed  for  them.  You  would  not  imagine  this  to  be 
dangerous work; but, looking back now, the wonder to me is 
that any of us are alive to tell the tale. They were not hoops, 
they were demons. First they would not fit into their sockets at 
all, and we had to jump on them, and kick them, and hammer 
at them with the boat-hook; and, when they were in, it turned 
out that they were the wrong hoops for those particular sock-
ets, and they had to come out again.

But they would not come out, until two of us had gone and 
struggled with them for five minutes, when they would jump 
up suddenly, and try and throw us into the water and drown 
us.  They  had  hinges  in  the  middle,  and,  when  we  were  not 
looking, they nipped us with these hinges in delicate parts of 
the body; and, while we were wrestling with one side of the 
hoop, and endeavouring to persuade it to do its duty, the other 
side would come behind us in a cowardly manner, and hit us 
over the head.

We got them fixed at last, and then all that was to be done 
was to arrange the covering over them. George unrolled it, and 
fastened one end over the nose of the boat. Harris stood in the 
middle to take it from George and roll it on to me, and I kept 
by the stern to receive it. It was a long time coming down to 
me. George did his part all right, but it was new work to Harris, 
and he bungled it.

How  he  managed  it  I  do  not  know,  he  could  not  explain 
himself;  but  by  some  mysterious  process  or  other  he  suc-
ceeded,  after  ten  minutes  of  superhuman  effort,  in  getting 
himself completely rolled up in it. He was so firmly wrapped 
round and tucked in and folded over, that he could not get out. 
He, of course, made frantic struggles for freedom — the birth-
right of every Englishman, — and, in doing so (I learned this 
afterwards), knocked over George; and then George, swearing 

— 99 —

at Harris, began to struggle too, and got himself entangled and 
rolled up.

I knew nothing about all this at the time. I did not under-
stand the business at all myself. I had been told to stand where 
I was, and wait till the canvas came to me, and Montmorency 
and I stood there and waited, both as good as gold. We could 
see the canvas being violently jerked and tossed about, pretty 
considerably;  but  we  supposed  this  was  part  of  the  method, 
and did not interfere.

We  also  heard  much  smothered  language  coming  from 
underneath it, and we guessed that they were finding the job 
rather troublesome, and concluded that we would wait until 
things had got a little simpler before we joined in.

We waited some time, but matters seemed to get only more 
and more involved, until, at last, George’s head came wriggling 
out over the side of the boat, and spoke up.

It said:
“Give us a hand here, can’t you, you cuckoo; standing there 
like a stuffed mummy, when you see we are both being suffo-
cated, you dummy!”

I never could withstand an appeal for help, so I went and un-
did them; not before it was time, either, for Harris was nearly 
black in the face.

It took us half an hour’s hard labour, after that, before it was 
properly up, and then we cleared the decks, and got out supper. 
We put the kettle on to boil, up in the nose of the boat, and 
went down to the stern and pretended to take no notice of it, 
but set to work to get the other things out.

That is the only way to get a kettle to boil up the river. If it 
sees that you are waiting for it and are anxious, it will never 
even sing. You have to go away and begin your meal, as if you 
were not going to have any tea at all. You must not even look 
round at it. Then you will soon hear it sputtering away, mad to 
be made into tea.

It is a good plan, too, if you are in a great hurry, to talk very 
loudly to each other about how you don’t need any tea, and 

— 100 —

are not going to have any. You get near the kettle, so that it can 
overhear you, and then you shout out, “I don’t want any tea; do 
you, George?” to which George shouts back, “Oh, no, I don’t 
like  tea;  we’ll  have  lemonade  instead — tea’s  so  indigestible.” 
Upon which the kettle boils over, and puts the stove out.

We adopted this harmless bit of trickery, and the result was 
that, by the time everything else was ready, the tea was waiting. 
Then we lit the lantern, and squatted down to supper.

We wanted that supper.
For five-and-thirty minutes not a sound was heard through-
out the length and breadth of that boat, save the clank of cut-
lery and crockery, and the steady grinding of four sets of mo-
lars. At the end of five-and-thirty minutes, Harris said, “Ah!” 
and took his left leg out from under him and put his right one 
there instead.

Five minutes afterwards, George said, “Ah!” too, and threw 
his plate out on the bank; and, three minutes later than that, 
Montmorency gave the first sign of contentment he had ex-
hibited since we had started, and rolled over on his side, and 
spread his legs out; and then I said, “Ah!” and bent my head 
back, and bumped it against one of the hoops, but I did not 
mind it. I did not even swear.

How good one feels when one is full — how satisfied with 
ourselves  and  with  the  world!  People  who  have  tried  it,  tell 
me  that  a  clear  conscience  makes  you  very  happy  and  con-
tented; but a full stomach does the business quite as well, and 
is  cheaper,  and  more  easily  obtained.  One  feels  so  forgiving 
and generous after a substantial and well-digested meal — so 
noble-minded, so kindly-hearted.

It  is  very  strange,  this  domination  of  our  intellect  by  our 
digestive organs. We cannot work, we cannot think, unless our 
stomach wills so. It dictates to us our emotions, our passions. 
After eggs and bacon, it says, “Work!” After beefsteak and por-
ter, it says, “Sleep!” After a cup of tea (two spoonsful for each 
cup,  and  don’t  let  it  stand  more  than  three  minutes),  it  says 
to the brain, “Now, rise, and show your strength. Be eloquent, 

— 101 —

and  deep,  and  tender;  see,  with  a  clear  eye,  into  Nature  and 
into life; spread your white wings of quivering thought, and 
soar, a god-like spirit, over the whirling world beneath you, up 
through long lanes of flaming stars to the gates of eternity!”

After hot muffins, it says, “Be dull and soulless, like a beast 
of the field — a brainless animal, with listless eye, unlit by any 
ray  of  fancy,  or  of  hope,  or  fear,  or  love,  or  life.”  And  after 
brandy, taken in sufficient quantity, it says, “Now, come, fool, 
grin and tumble, that your fellow-men may laugh — drivel in 
folly, and splutter in senseless sounds, and show what a help-
less ninny is poor man whose wit and will are drowned, like 
kittens, side by side, in half an inch of alcohol.”

We are but the veriest, sorriest slaves of our stomach. Reach 
not after morality and righteousness, my friends; watch vigi-
lantly your stomach, and diet it with care and judgment. Then 
virtue and contentment will come and reign within your heart, 
unsought by any effort of your own; and you will be a good 
citizen, a loving husband, and a tender father — a noble, pious 
man.

Before our supper, Harris and George and I were quarrel-
some  and  snappy  and  ill-tempered;  after  our  supper,  we  sat 
and  beamed  on  one  another,  and  we  beamed  upon  the  dog, 
too. We loved each other, we loved everybody. Harris, in mov-
ing  about,  trod  on  George’s  corn.  Had  this  happened  before 
supper, George would have expressed wishes and desires con-
cerning Harris’s fate in this world and the next that would have 
made a thoughtful man shudder.

As it was, he said: “Steady, old man; ’ware wheat.”
And  Harris,  instead  of  merely  observing,  in  his  most  un-
pleasant  tones,  that  a  fellow  could  hardly  help  treading  on 
some bit of George’s foot, if he had to move about at all within 
ten yards of where George was sitting, suggesting that George 
never ought to come into an ordinary sized boat with feet that 
length,  and  advising  him  to  hang  them  over  the  side,  as  he 
would have done before supper, now said: “Oh, I’m so sorry, 
old chap; I hope I haven’t hurt you.”

— 102 —

And George said: “Not at all;” that it was his fault; and Har-

ris said no, it was his.

It was quite pretty to hear them.
We lit our pipes, and sat, looking out on the quiet night, and 

talked.

George  said  why  could  not  we  be  always  like  this — away 
from  the  world,  with  its  sin  and  temptation,  leading  sober, 
peaceful lives, and doing good. I said it was the sort of thing I 
had often longed for myself; and we discussed the possibility 
of our going away, we four, to some handy, well-fitted desert 
island, and living there in the woods.

Harris said that the danger about desert islands, as far as he 
had heard, was that they were so damp: but George said no, not 
if properly drained.

And then we got on to drains, and that put George in mind 
of a very funny thing that happened to his father once. He said 
his  father  was  travelling  with  another  fellow  through Wales, 
and, one night, they stopped at a little inn, where there were 
some  other  fellows,  and  they  joined  the  other  fellows,  and 
spent the evening with them.

They had a very jolly evening, and sat up late, and, by the 
time  they  came  to  go  to  bed,  they  (this  was  when  George’s 
father  was  a  very  young  man)  were  slightly  jolly,  too.  They 
(George’s father and George’s father’s friend) were to sleep in 
the  same  room,  but  in  different  beds.  They  took  the  candle, 
and  went  up.  The  candle  lurched  up  against  the  wall  when 
they got into the room, and went out, and they had to undress 
and grope into bed in the dark. This they did; but, instead of 
getting  into  separate  beds,  as  they  thought  they  were  doing, 
they both climbed into the same one without knowing it — one 
getting in with his head at the top, and the other crawling in 
from the opposite side of the compass, and lying with his feet 
on the pillow.

There was silence for a moment, and then George’s father 

said:

“Joe!”

— 103 —

“What’s the matter, Tom?” replied Joe’s voice from the other 

“Why, there’s a man in my bed,” said George’s father; “here’s 

end of the bed.

his feet on my pillow.”

“Well, it’s an extraordinary thing, Tom,” answered the other; 

“but I’m blest if there isn’t a man in my bed, too!”

“What are you going to do?” asked George’s father.
“Well, I’m going to chuck him out,” replied Joe.
“So am I,” said George’s father, valiantly.
There was a brief struggle, followed by two heavy bumps on 

the floor, and then a rather doleful voice said:

“I say, Tom!”
“Yes!”
“How have you got on?”
“Well, to tell you the truth, my man’s chucked me out.”
“So’s mine! I say, I don’t think much of this inn, do you?”
“What was the name of that inn?” said Harris.
“The Pig and Whistle,” said George. “Why?”
“Ah, no, then it isn’t the same,” replied Harris.
“What do you mean?” queried George.
“Why it’s so curious,” murmured Harris, “but precisely that 
very same thing happened to my father once at a country inn. 
I’ve often heard him tell the tale. I thought it might have been 
the same inn.”

We turned in at ten that night, and I thought I should sleep 
well, being tired; but I didn’t. As a rule, I undress and put my 
head  on  the  pillow,  and  then  somebody  bangs  at  the  door, 
and says it is half-past eight: but, to-night, everything seemed 
against me; the novelty of it all, the hardness of the boat, the 
cramped position (I was lying with my feet under one seat, and 
my head on another), the sound of the lapping water round the 
boat, and the wind among the branches, kept me restless and 
disturbed.

I did get to sleep for a few hours, and then some part of the 
boat which seemed to have grown up in the night — for it cer-
tainly was not there when we started, and it had disappeared 

— 104 —

by the morning — kept digging into my spine. I slept through 
it for a while, dreaming that I had swallowed a sovereign, and 
that they were cutting a hole in my back with a gimlet, so as 
to try and get it out. I thought it very unkind of them, and I 
told them I would owe them the money, and they should have 
it at the end of the month. But they would not hear of that, 
and said it would be much better if they had it then, because 
otherwise the interest would accumulate so. I got quite cross 
with them after a bit, and told them what I thought of them, 
and  then  they  gave  the  gimlet  such  an  excruciating  wrench 
that I woke up.

The boat seemed stuffy, and my head ached; so I thought I 
would step out into the cool night-air. I slipped on what clothes 
I could find about — some of my own, and some of George’s 
and Harris’s — and crept under the canvas on to the bank.

It was a glorious night. The moon had sunk, and left the qui-
et earth alone with the stars. It seemed as if, in the silence and 
the hush, while we her children slept, they were talking with 
her, their sister — conversing of mighty mysteries in voices too 
vast and deep for childish human ears to catch the sound.

They awe us, these strange stars, so cold, so clear. We are as 
children whose small feet have strayed into some dim-lit tem-
ple of the god they have been taught to worship but know not; 
and, standing where the echoing dome spans the long vista of 
the  shadowy  light,  glance  up,  half  hoping,  half  afraid  to  see 
some awful vision hovering there.

And  yet  it  seems  so  full  of  comfort  and  of  strength,  the 
night.  In  its  great  presence,  our  small  sorrows  creep  away, 
ashamed. The day has been so full of fret and care, and our 
hearts  have  been  so  full  of  evil  and  of  bitter  thoughts,  and 
the world has seemed so hard and wrong to us. Then Night, 
like some great loving mother, gently lays her hand upon our 
fevered head, and turns our little tear-stained faces up to hers, 
and smiles; and, though she does not speak, we know what she 
would say, and lay our hot flushed cheek against her bosom, 
and the pain is gone.

— 105 —

Sometimes, our pain is very deep and real, and we stand be-
fore her very silent, because there is no language for our pain, 
only a moan. Night’s heart is full of pity for us: she cannot ease 
our  aching;  she  takes  our  hand  in  hers,  and  the  little  world 
grows very small and very far away beneath us, and, borne on 
her dark wings, we pass for a moment into a mightier Presence 
than her own, and in the wondrous light of that great Presence, 
all human life lies like a book before us, and we know that Pain 
and Sorrow are but the angels of God.

Only those who have worn the crown of suffering can look 
upon that wondrous light; and they, when they return, may not 
speak of it, or tell the mystery they know.

Once  upon  a  time,  through  a  strange  country,  there  rode 
some goodly knights, and their path lay by a deep wood, where 
tangled briars grew very thick and strong, and tore the flesh 
of them that lost their way therein. And the leaves of the trees 
that grew in the wood were very dark and thick, so that no ray 
of light came through the branches to lighten the gloom and 
sadness.

And, as they passed by that dark wood, one knight of those 
that rode, missing his comrades, wandered far away, and re-
turned  to  them  no  more;  and  they,  sorely  grieving,  rode  on 
without him, mourning him as one dead.

Now, when they reached the fair castle towards which they 
had been journeying, they stayed there many days, and made 
merry; and one night, as they sat in cheerful ease around the 
logs that burned in the great hall, and drank a loving measure, 
there came the comrade they had lost, and greeted them. His 
clothes  were  ragged,  like  a  beggar’s,  and  many  sad  wounds 
were on his sweet flesh, but upon his face there shone a great 
radiance of deep joy.

And  they  questioned  him,  asking  him  what  had  befallen 
him: and he told them how in the dark wood he had lost his 
way,  and  had  wandered  many  days  and  nights,  till,  torn  and 
bleeding, he had lain him down to die.

Then, when he was nigh unto death, lo! through the savage 

— 106 —

gloom there came to him a stately maiden, and took him by 
the hand and led him on through devious paths, unknown to 
any man, until upon the darkness of the wood there dawned a 
light such as the light of day was unto but as a little lamp unto 
the  sun;  and,  in  that  wondrous  light,  our  way-worn  knight 
saw as in a dream a vision, and so glorious, so fair the vision 
seemed, that of his bleeding wounds he thought no more, but 
stood as one entranced, whose joy is deep as is the sea, whereof 
no man can tell the depth.

And  the  vision  faded,  and  the  knight,  kneeling  upon  the 
ground, thanked the good saint who into that sad wood had 
strayed his steps, so he had seen the vision that lay there hid.
And the name of the dark forest was Sorrow; but of the vi-
sion that the good knight saw therein we may not speak nor 
tell.

CHAPTER XI.

How  George,  once  upon  a  time,  got  up  early  in  the  morning. — 
George, Harris, and Montmorency do not like the look of the cold 
water. — Heroism  and  determination  on  the  part  of  J. — George 
and his shirt: story with a moral. — Harris as cook. — Historical 

retrospect, specially inserted for the use of schools.

I  WOKE  at  six  the  next  morning;  and  found  George  awake 
too.  We  both  turned  round,  and  tried  to  go  to  sleep  again, 
but we could not. Had there been any particular reason why 
we should not have gone to sleep again, but have got up and 
dressed then and there, we should have dropped off while we 
were looking at our watches, and have slept till ten. As there 
was no earthly necessity for our getting up under another two 
hours at the very least, and our getting up at that time was an 
utter absurdity, it was only in keeping with the natural cussed-
ness of things in general that we should both feel that lying 
down for five minutes more would be death to us.

George  said  that  the  same  kind  of  thing,  only  worse,  had 
happened  to  him  some  eighteen  months  ago,  when  he  was 
lodging  by  himself  in  the  house  of  a  certain  Mrs.  Gippings. 
He said his watch went wrong one evening, and stopped at a 
quarter-past eight. He did not know this at the time because, 
for some reason or other, he forgot to wind it up when he went 
to bed (an unusual occurrence with him), and hung it up over 
his pillow without ever looking at the thing.

It  was  in  the  winter  when  this  happened,  very  near  the 
shortest day, and a week of fog into the bargain, so the fact that 
it was still very dark when George woke in the morning was no 
guide to him as to the time. He reached up, and hauled down 
his watch. It was a quarter-past eight.

“Angels  and  ministers  of  grace  defend  us!”  exclaimed 
George; “and here have I got to be in the City by nine. Why 
didn’t somebody call me? Oh, this is a shame!” And he flung 
the watch down, and sprang out of bed, and had a cold bath, 
and washed himself, and dressed himself, and shaved himself 

— 108 —

in cold water because there was not time to wait for the hot, 
and then rushed and had another look at the watch.

Whether the shaking it had received in being thrown down 
on the bed had started it, or how it was, George could not say, 
but certain it was that from a quarter-past eight it had begun 
to go, and now pointed to twenty minutes to nine.

George snatched it up, and rushed downstairs. In the sitting-
room, all was dark and silent: there was no fire, no breakfast. 
George said it was a wicked shame of Mrs. G., and he made 
up his mind to tell her what he thought of her when he came 
home in the evening. Then he dashed on his great-coat and 
hat,  and,  seizing  his  umbrella,  made  for  the  front  door.  The 
door was not even unbolted. George anathematized Mrs. G. for 
a lazy old woman, and thought it was very strange that people 
could not get up at a decent, respectable time, unlocked and 
unbolted the door, and ran out.

He ran hard for a quarter of a mile, and at the end of that 
distance  it  began  to  be  borne  in  upon  him  as  a  strange  and 
curious  thing  that  there  were  so  few  people  about,  and  that 
there  were  no  shops  open.  It  was  certainly  a  very  dark  and 
foggy morning, but still it seemed an unusual course to stop 
all  business  on  that  account.  He  had  to  go  to  business:  why 
should  other  people  stop  in  bed  merely  because  it  was  dark 
and foggy!

At length he reached Holborn. Not a shutter was down! not 
a bus was about! There were three men in sight, one of whom 
was a policeman; a market-cart full of cabbages, and a dilapi-
dated looking cab. George pulled out his watch and looked at 
it: it was five minutes to nine! He stood still and counted his 
pulse. He stooped down and felt his legs. Then, with his watch 
still in his hand, he went up to the policeman, and asked him if 
he knew what the time was.

“What’s  the  time?”  said  the  man,  eyeing  George  up  and 
down with evident suspicion; “why, if you listen you will hear 
it strike.”

— 109 —

George  listened,  and  a  neighbouring  clock  immediately 

“But it’s only gone three!” said George in an injured tone, 

“Well,  and  how  many  did  you  want  it  to  go?”  replied  the 

obliged.

constable.

when it had finished.

“Why, nine,” said George, showing his watch.
“Do you know where you live?” said the guardian of public 

order, severely.

George thought, and gave the address.
“Oh! that’s where it is, is it?” replied the man; “well, you take 
my advice and go there quietly, and take that watch of yours 
with you; and don’t let’s have any more of it.”

And George went home again, musing as he walked along, 

and let himself in.

At first, when he got in, he determined to undress and go to 
bed again; but when he thought of the redressing and re-wash-
ing, and the having of another bath, he determined he would 
not, but would sit up and go to sleep in the easy-chair.

But  he  could  not  get  to  sleep:  he  never  felt  more  wakeful 
in his life; so he lit the lamp and got out the chess-board, and 
played himself a game of chess. But even that did not enliven 
him: it seemed slow somehow; so he gave chess up and tried to 
read. He did not seem able to take any sort of interest in read-
ing either, so he put on his coat again and went out for a walk.
It was horribly lonesome and dismal, and all the policemen 
he met regarded him with undisguised suspicion, and turned 
their lanterns on him and followed him about, and this had 
such an effect upon him at last that he began to feel as if he 
really had done something, and he got to slinking down the 
by-streets  and  hiding  in  dark  doorways  when  he  heard  the 
regulation flip-flop approaching.

Of course, this conduct made the force only more distrust-
ful of him than ever, and they would come and rout him out 
and ask him what he was doing there; and when he answered, 
“Nothing,”  he  had  merely  come  out  for  a  stroll  (it  was  then 

— 110 —

four o’clock in the morning), they looked as though they did 
not believe him, and two plain-clothes constables came home 
with him to see if he really did live where he had said he did. 
They saw him go in with his key, and then they took up a posi-
tion opposite and watched the house.

He thought he would light the fire when he got inside, and 
make himself some breakfast, just to pass away the time; but 
he did not seem able to handle anything from a scuttleful of 
coals to a teaspoon without dropping it or falling over it, and 
making such a noise that he was in mortal fear that it would 
wake Mrs. G. up, and that she would think it was burglars and 
open the window and call “Police!” and then these two detec-
tives would rush in and handcuff him, and march him off to 
the police-court.

He was in a morbidly nervous state by this time, and he pic-
tured the trial, and his trying to explain the circumstances to 
the jury, and nobody believing him, and his being sentenced to 
twenty years’ penal servitude, and his mother dying of a bro-
ken heart. So he gave up trying to get breakfast, and wrapped 
himself up in his overcoat and sat in the easy-chair till Mrs. G 
came down at half-past seven.

He said he had never got up too early since that morning: it 

had been such a warning to him.

We had been sitting huddled up in our rugs while George 
had been telling me this true story, and on his finishing it I 
set to work to wake up Harris with a scull. The third prod did 
it: and he turned over on the other side, and said he would be 
down in a minute, and that he would have his lace-up boots. 
We soon let him know where he was, however, by the aid of the 
hitcher, and he sat up suddenly, sending Montmorency, who 
had been sleeping the sleep of the just right on the middle of 
his chest, sprawling across the boat.

Then we pulled up the canvas, and all four of us poked our 
heads out over the off-side, and looked down at the water and 
shivered. The idea, overnight, had been that we should get up 
early in the morning, fling off our rugs and shawls, and, throw-

— 111 —

ing back the canvas, spring into the river with a joyous shout, 
and revel in a long delicious swim. Somehow, now the morning 
had come, the notion seemed less tempting. The water looked 
damp and chilly: the wind felt cold.

“Well, who’s going to be first in?” said Harris at last.
There was no rush for precedence. George settled the matter 
so far as he was concerned by retiring into the boat and pulling 
on his socks. Montmorency gave vent to an involuntary howl, 
as if merely thinking of the thing had given him the horrors; 
and  Harris  said  it  would  be  so  difficult  to  get  into  the  boat 
again, and went back and sorted out his trousers.

I did not altogether like to give in, though I did not relish 
the plunge. There might be snags about, or weeds, I thought. I 
meant to compromise matters by going down to the edge and 
just throwing the water over myself; so I took a towel and crept 
out on the bank and wormed my way along on to the branch of 
a tree that dipped down into the water.

It was bitterly cold. The wind cut like a knife. I thought I 
would  not  throw  the  water  over  myself  after  all.  I  would  go 
back into the boat and dress; and I turned to do so; and, as I 
turned, the silly branch gave way, and I and the towel went in 
together with a tremendous splash, and I was out mid-stream 
with a gallon of Thames water inside me before I knew what 
had happened.

“By Jove! old J.’s gone in,” I heard Harris say, as I came blow-
ing to the surface. “I didn’t think he’d have the pluck to do it. 
Did you?”

“Is it all right?” sung out George.
“Lovely,” I spluttered back. “You are duffers not to come in. I 
wouldn’t have missed this for worlds. Why won’t you try it? It 
only wants a little determination.”
But I could not persuade them.
Rather  an  amusing  thing  happened  while  dressing  that 
morning. I was very cold when I got back into the boat, and, 
in  my  hurry  to  get  my  shirt  on,  I  accidentally  jerked  it  into 
the water. It made me awfully wild, especially as George burst 

— 112 —

out laughing. I could not see anything to laugh at, and I told 
George so, and he only laughed the more. I never saw a man 
laugh so much. I quite lost my temper with him at last, and I 
pointed  out  to  him  what  a  drivelling  maniac  of  an  imbecile 
idiot he was; but he only roared the louder. And then, just as I 
was landing the shirt, I noticed that it was not my shirt at all, 
but George’s, which I had mistaken for mine; whereupon the 
humour of the thing struck me for the first time, and I began 
to  laugh. And  the  more  I  looked  from  George’s  wet  shirt  to 
George, roaring with laughter, the more I was amused, and I 
laughed so much that I had to let the shirt fall back into the 
water again.

“Ar’n’t  you — you — going  to  get  it  out?”  said  George,  be-

tween his shrieks.

I could not answer him at all for a while, I was laughing so, 

but, at last, between my peals I managed to jerk out:

“It isn’t my shirt — it’s yours!”
I never saw a man’s face change from lively to severe so sud-

denly in all my life before.

“What!”  he  yelled,  springing  up. “You  silly  cuckoo!  Why 
can’t you be more careful what you’re doing? Why the deuce 
don’t you go and dress on the bank? You’re not fit to be in a 
boat, you’re not. Gimme the hitcher.”

I tried to make him see the fun of the thing, but he could 

not. George is very dense at seeing a joke sometimes.

Harris  proposed  that  we  should  have  scrambled  eggs  for 
breakfast.  He  said  he  would  cook  them.  It  seemed,  from  his 
account, that he was very good at doing scrambled eggs. He 
often did them at picnics and when out on yachts. He was quite 
famous for them. People who had once tasted his scrambled 
eggs,  so  we  gathered  from  his  conversation,  never  cared  for 
any other food afterwards, but pined away and died when they 
could not get them.

It made our mouths water to hear him talk about the things, 
and we handed him out the stove and the frying-pan and all 

— 113 —

the eggs that had not smashed and gone over everything in the 
hamper, and begged him to begin.

He had some trouble in breaking the eggs — or rather not 
so much trouble in breaking them exactly as in getting them 
into  the  frying-pan  when  broken,  and  keeping  them  off  his 
trousers,  and  preventing  them  from  running  up  his  sleeve; 
but he fixed some half-a-dozen into the pan at last, and then 
squatted down by the side of the stove and chivied them about 
with a fork.

It seemed harassing work, so far as George and I could judge. 
Whenever he went near the pan he burned himself, and then 
he would drop everything and dance round the stove, flicking 
his  fingers  about  and  cursing  the  things.  Indeed,  every  time 
George and I looked round at him he was sure to be perform-
ing this feat. We thought at first that it was a necessary part of 
the culinary arrangements.

We did not know what scrambled eggs were, and we fancied 
that it must be some Red Indian or Sandwich Islands sort of 
dish that required dances and incantations for its proper cook-
ing. Montmorency went and put his nose over it once, and the 
fat spluttered up and scalded him, and then he began dancing 
and cursing. Altogether it was one of the most interesting and 
exciting operations I have ever witnessed. George and I were 
both quite sorry when it was over.

The  result  was  not  altogether  the  success  that  Harris  had 
anticipated. There seemed so little to show for the business. Six 
eggs had gone into the frying-pan, and all that came out was a 
teaspoonful of burnt and unappetizing looking mess.

Harris said it was the fault of the frying-pan, and thought it 
would have gone better if we had had a fish-kettle and a gas-
stove; and we decided not to attempt the dish again until we 
had those aids to housekeeping by us.

The sun had got more powerful by the time we had finished 
breakfast,  and  the  wind  had  dropped,  and  it  was  as  lovely  a 
morning as one could desire. Little was in sight to remind us of 
the nineteenth century; and, as we looked out upon the river 

— 114 —

in the morning sunlight, we could almost fancy that the centu-
ries between us and that ever-to-be-famous June morning of 
1215 had been drawn aside, and that we, English yeomen’s sons 
in homespun cloth, with dirk at belt, were waiting there to wit-
ness the writing of that stupendous page of history, the mean-
ing whereof was to be translated to the common people some 
four hundred and odd years later by one Oliver Cromwell, who 
had deeply studied it.

It  is  a  fine  summer  morning — sunny,  soft,  and  still.  But 
through the air there runs a thrill of coming stir. King John 
has slept at Duncroft Hall, and all the day before the little town 
of Staines has echoed to the clang of armed men, and the clat-
ter of great horses over its rough stones, and the shouts of cap-
tains, and the grim oaths and surly jests of bearded bowmen, 
billmen, pikemen, and strange-speaking foreign spearmen.

Gay-cloaked companies of knights and squires have ridden 
in, all travel-stained and dusty. And all the evening long the 
timid townsmen’s doors have had to be quick opened to let in 
rough groups of soldiers, for whom there must be found both 
board  and  lodging,  and  the  best  of  both,  or  woe  betide  the 
house and all within; for the sword is judge and jury, plaintiff 
and executioner, in these tempestuous times, and pays for what 
it takes by sparing those from whom it takes it, if it pleases it 
to do so.

Round the camp-fire in the market-place gather still more 
of  the  Barons’  troops,  and  eat  and  drink  deep,  and  bellow 
forth  roystering  drinking  songs,  and  gamble  and  quarrel  as 
the evening grows and deepens into night. The firelight sheds 
quaint shadows on their piled-up arms and on their uncouth 
forms.  The  children  of  the  town  steal  round  to  watch  them, 
wondering; and brawny country wenches, laughing, draw near 
to bandy ale-house jest and jibe with the swaggering troopers, 
so  unlike  the  village  swains,  who,  now  despised,  stand  apart 
behind,  with  vacant  grins  upon  their  broad,  peering  faces. 
And out from the fields around, glitter the faint lights of more 
distant camps, as here some great lord’s followers lie mustered, 

— 115 —

and there false John’s French mercenaries hover like crouching 
wolves without the town.

And  so,  with  sentinel  in  each  dark  street,  and  twinkling 
watch-fires on each height around, the night has worn away, 
and over this fair valley of old Thame has broken the morning 
of the great day that is to close so big with the fate of ages yet 
unborn.

Ever since grey dawn, in the lower of the two islands, just 
above  where  we  are  standing,  there  has  been  great  clamour, 
and the sound of many workmen. The great pavilion brought 
there yester eve is being raised, and carpenters are busy nailing 
tiers of seats, while ’prentices from London town are there with 
many-coloured stuffs and silks and cloth of gold and silver.

And  now,  lo!  down  upon  the  road  that  winds  along  the 
river’s  bank  from  Staines  there  come  towards  us,  laughing 
and  talking  together  in  deep  guttural  bass,  a  half-a-score  of 
stalwart halbert-men — Barons’ men, these — and halt at a hun-
dred yards or so above us, on the other bank, and lean upon 
their arms, and wait.

And so, from hour to hour, march up along the road ever 
fresh  groups  and  bands  of  armed  men,  their  casques  and 
breastplates flashing back the long low lines of morning sun-
light, until, as far as eye can reach, the way seems thick with 
glittering steel and prancing steeds. And shouting horsemen 
are galloping from group to group, and little banners are flut-
tering lazily in the warm breeze, and every now and then there 
is a deeper stir as the ranks make way on either side, and some 
great Baron on his war-horse, with his guard of squires around 
him, passes along to take his station at the head of his serfs 
and vassals.

And up the slope of Cooper’s Hill, just opposite, are gath-
ered the wondering rustics and curious townsfolk, who have 
run from Staines, and none are quite sure what the bustle is 
about, but each one has a different version of the great event 
that they have come to see; and some say that much good to 

— 116 —

all the people will come from this day’s work; but the old men 
shake their heads, for they have heard such tales before.

And all the river down to Staines is dotted with small craft 
and  boats  and  tiny  coracles — which  last  are  growing  out  of 
favour  now,  and  are  used  only  by  the  poorer  folk.  Over  the 
rapids, where in after years trim Bell Weir lock will stand, they 
have been forced or dragged by their sturdy rowers, and now 
are crowding up as near as they dare come to the great covered 
barges, which lie in readiness to bear King John to where the 
fateful Charter waits his signing.

It is noon, and we and all the people have been waiting pa-
tient for many an hour, and the rumour has run round that 
slippery John has again escaped from the Barons’ grasp, and 
has stolen away from Duncroft Hall with his mercenaries at his 
heels, and will soon be doing other work than signing charters 
for his people’s liberty.

Not so! This time the grip upon him has been one of iron, 
and he has slid and wriggled in vain. Far down the road a little 
cloud of dust has risen, and draws nearer and grows larger, and 
the pattering of many hoofs grows louder, and in and out be-
tween the scattered groups of drawn-up men, there pushes on 
its way a brilliant cavalcade of gay-dressed lords and knights. 
And front and rear, and either flank, there ride the yeomen of 
the Barons, and in the midst King John.

He rides to where the barges lie in readiness, and the great 
Barons step forth from their ranks to meet him. He greets them 
with a smile and laugh, and pleasant honeyed words, as though 
it were some feast in his honour to which he had been invited. 
But as he rises to dismount, he casts one hurried glance from 
his own French mercenaries drawn up in the rear to the grim 
ranks of the Barons’ men that hem him in.

Is it too late? One fierce blow at the unsuspecting horseman 
at his side, one cry to his French troops, one desperate charge 
upon the unready lines before him, and these rebellious Bar-
ons might rue the day they dared to thwart his plans! A bolder 
hand  might  have  turned  the  game  even  at  that  point.  Had 

— 117 —

it  been  a  Richard  there!  the  cup  of  liberty  might  have  been 
dashed from England’s lips, and the taste of freedom held back 
for a hundred years.

But the heart of King John sinks before the stern faces of the 
English fighting men, and the arm of King John drops back on 
to his rein, and he dismounts and takes his seat in the foremost 
barge. And the Barons follow in, with each mailed hand upon 
the sword-hilt, and the word is given to let go.

Slowly  the  heavy,  bright-decked  barges  leave  the  shore  of 
Runningmede. Slowly against the swift current they work their 
ponderous way, till, with a low grumble, they grate against the 
bank of the little island that from this day will bear the name 
of  Magna  Charta  Island.  And  King  John  has  stepped  upon 
the shore, and we wait in breathless silence till a great shout 
cleaves the air, and the great cornerstone in England’s temple 
of liberty has, now we know, been firmly laid.

CHAPTER XII.

Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn. — Disadvantages of living in same 
house  with  pair  of  lovers. — A  trying  time  for  the  English  na-
tion. — A night search for the picturesque. — Homeless and house-
less. — Harris  prepares  to  die. — An  angel  comes  along. — Effect 
of sudden joy on Harris. — A little supper. — Lunch. — High price 
for mustard. — A fearful battle. — Maidenhead. — Sailing. — Three 

fishers. — We are cursed.

I WAS sitting on the bank, conjuring up this scene to myself, 
when George remarked that when I was quite rested, perhaps 
I would not mind helping to wash up; and, thus recalled from 
the days of the glorious past to the prosaic present, with all its 
misery and sin, I slid down into the boat and cleaned out the 
frying-pan with a stick of wood and a tuft of grass, polishing it 
up finally with George’s wet shirt.

We went over to Magna Charta Island, and had a look at the 
stone which stands in the cottage there and on which the great 
Charter is said to have been signed; though, as to whether it 
really was signed there, or, as some say, on the other bank at 
“Runningmede,” I decline to commit myself. As far as my own 
personal opinion goes, however, I am inclined to give weight to 
the popular island theory. Certainly, had I been one of the Bar-
ons, at the time, I should have strongly urged upon my com-
rades the advisability of our getting such a slippery customer 
as King John on to the island, where there was less chance of 
surprises and tricks.

There are the ruins of an old priory in the grounds of Ank-
erwyke House, which is close to Picnic Point, and it was round 
about the grounds of this old priory that Henry VIII. is said to 
have waited for and met Anne Boleyn. He also used to meet 
her at Hever Castle in Kent, and also somewhere near St. Al-
bans. It must have been difficult for the people of England in 
those days to have found a spot where these thoughtless young 
folk were not spooning.

Have  you  ever  been  in  a  house  where  there  are  a  couple 
courting? It is most trying. You think you will go and sit in the 

— 119 —

drawing-room, and you march off there. As you open the door, 
you  hear  a  noise  as  if  somebody  had  suddenly  recollected 
something, and, when you get in, Emily is over by the window, 
full of interest in the opposite side of the road, and your friend, 
John Edward, is at the other end of the room with his whole 
soul held in thrall by photographs of other people’s relatives.

“Oh!” you say, pausing at the door, “I didn’t know anybody 

was here.”

“Oh! didn’t you?” says Emily, coldly, in a tone which implies 

that she does not believe you.

You hang about for a bit, then you say:
“It’s very dark. Why don’t you light the gas?”
John  Edward  says, “Oh!”  he  hadn’t  noticed  it;  and  Emily 

says that papa does not like the gas lit in the afternoon.

You tell them one or two items of news, and give them your 
views and opinions on the Irish question; but this does not ap-
pear to interest them. All they remark on any subject is, “Oh!” 
“Is it?” “Did he?” “Yes,” and “You don’t say so!” And, after ten 
minutes of such style of conversation, you edge up to the door, 
and slip out, and are surprised to find that the door immedi-
ately closes behind you, and shuts itself, without your having 
touched it.

Half an hour later, you think you will try a pipe in the con-
servatory.  The  only  chair  in  the  place  is  occupied  by  Emily; 
and John Edward, if the language of clothes can be relied upon, 
has evidently been sitting on the floor. They do not speak, but 
they give you a look that says all that can be said in a civilised 
community;  and  you  back  out  promptly  and  shut  the  door 
behind you.

You are afraid to poke your nose into any room in the house 
now; so, after walking up and down the stairs for a while, you 
go and sit in your own bedroom. This becomes uninteresting, 
however, after a time, and so you put on your hat and stroll out 
into the garden. You walk down the path, and as you pass the 
summer-house you glance in, and there are those two young 
idiots, huddled up into one corner of it; and they see you, and 

— 120 —

are evidently under the idea that, for some wicked purpose of 
your own, you are following them about.

“Why don’t they have a special room for this sort of thing, 
and make people keep to it?” you mutter; and you rush back to 
the hall and get your umbrella and go out.

It  must  have  been  much  like  this  when  that  foolish  boy 
Henry VIII. was courting his little Anne. People in Bucking-
hamshire  would  have  come  upon  them  unexpectedly  when 
they were mooning round Windsor and Wraysbury, and have 
exclaimed, “Oh!  you  here!”  and  Henry  would  have  blushed 
and said, “Yes; he’d just come over to see a man;” and Anne 
would have said, “Oh, I’m so glad to see you! Isn’t it funny? I’ve 
just met Mr. Henry VIII. in the lane, and he’s going the same 
way I am.”

Then those people would have gone away and said to them-
selves: “Oh! we’d better get out of here while this billing and 
cooing is on. We’ll go down to Kent.”

And they would go to Kent, and the first thing they would 
see in Kent, when they got there, would be Henry and Anne 
fooling round Hever Castle.

“Oh, drat this!” they would have said. “Here, let’s go away. 
I can’t stand any more of it. Let’s go to St. Albans — nice quiet 
place, St. Albans.”

And  when  they  reached  St.  Albans,  there  would  be  that 
wretched  couple,  kissing  under  the Abbey  walls.  Then  these 
folks would go and be pirates until the marriage was over.

From Picnic Point to Old Windsor Lock is a delightful bit 
of the river. A shady road, dotted here and there with dainty 
little cottages, runs by the bank up to the “Bells of Ouseley,” a 
picturesque inn, as most up-river inns are, and a place where a 
very good glass of ale may be drunk — so Harris says; and on 
a matter of this kind you can take Harris’s word. Old Windsor 
is a famous spot in its way. Edward the Confessor had a palace 
here, and here the great Earl Godwin was proved guilty by the 
justice  of  that  age  of  having  encompassed  the  death  of  the 

— 121 —

King’s brother. Earl Godwin broke a piece of bread and held it 
in his hand.

“If  I  am  guilty,”  said  the  Earl, “may  this  bread  choke  me 

when I eat it!”

Then he put the bread into his mouth and swallowed it, and 

it choked him, and he died.

After you pass Old Windsor, the river is somewhat uninter-
esting, and does not become itself again until you are nearing 
Boveney. George and I towed up past the Home Park, which 
stretches along the right bank from Albert to Victoria Bridge; 
and as we were passing Datchet, George asked me if I remem-
bered our first trip up the river, and when we landed at Datchet 
at ten o’clock at night, and wanted to go to bed.

I answered that I did remember it. It will be some time be-

fore I forget it.

It  was  the  Saturday  before  the  August  Bank  Holiday.  We 
were  tired  and  hungry,  we  same  three,  and  when  we  got  to 
Datchet we took out the hamper, the two bags, and the rugs 
and coats, and such like things, and started off to look for dig-
gings. We passed a very pretty little hotel, with clematis and 
creeper over the porch; but there was no honeysuckle about 
it, and, for some reason or other, I had got my mind fixed on 
honeysuckle, and I said:

“Oh, don’t let’s go in there! Let’s go on a bit further, and see 

if there isn’t one with honeysuckle over it.”

So  we  went  on  till  we  came  to  another  hotel.  That  was  a 
very nice hotel, too, and it had honey-suckle on it, round at the 
side; but Harris did not like the look of a man who was lean-
ing against the front door. He said he didn’t look a nice man at 
all, and he wore ugly boots: so we went on further. We went a 
goodish way without coming across any more hotels, and then 
we met a man, and asked him to direct us to a few.

He said:
“Why, you are coming away from them. You must turn right 

round and go back, and then you will come to the Stag.”

We said:

— 122 —

“Oh, we had been there, and didn’t like it — no honeysuckle 

over it.”

“Well, then,” he said, “there’s the Manor House, just oppo-

site. Have you tried that?”

Harris replied that we did not want to go there — didn’t like 
the looks of a man who was stopping there — Harris did not 
like the colour of his hair, didn’t like his boots, either.

“Well, I don’t know what you’ll do, I’m sure,” said our in-

formant; “because they are the only two inns in the place.”

“No other inns!” exclaimed Harris.
“None,” replied the man.
“What on earth are we to do?” cried Harris.
Then George spoke up. He said Harris and I could get an 
hotel built for us, if we liked, and have some people made to 
put in. For his part, he was going back to the Stag.

The greatest minds never realise their ideals in any matter; 
and Harris and I sighed over the hollowness of all earthly de-
sires, and followed George.

We took our traps into the Stag, and laid them down in the 

hall.

please.”

manage it.”

The landlord came up and said:
“Good evening, gentlemen.”
“Oh,  good  evening,”  said  George;  “we  want  three  beds, 

“Very sorry, sir,” said the landlord; “but I’m afraid we can’t 

“Oh, well, never mind,” said George, “two will do. Two of us 
can sleep in one bed, can’t we?” he continued, turning to Har-
ris and me.

Harris said, “Oh, yes;” he thought George and I could sleep 

in one bed very easily.

“Very sorry, sir,” again repeated the landlord: “but we really 
haven’t  got  a  bed  vacant  in  the  whole  house.  In  fact,  we  are 
putting two, and even three gentlemen in one bed, as it is.”

This staggered us for a bit.

— 123 —

But Harris, who is an old traveller, rose to the occasion, and, 

laughing cheerily, said:

“Oh, well, we can’t help it. We must rough it. You must give 

us a shake-down in the billiard-room.”

“Very sorry, sir. Three gentlemen sleeping on the billiard-
table already, and two in the coffee-room. Can’t possibly take 
you in to-night.”

We picked up our things, and went over to the Manor House. 
It was a pretty little place. I said I thought I should like it bet-
ter than the other house; and Harris said, “Oh, yes,” it would 
be all right, and we needn’t look at the man with the red hair; 
besides, the poor fellow couldn’t help having red hair.

Harris spoke quite kindly and sensibly about it.
The people at the Manor House did not wait to hear us talk. 
The landlady met us on the doorstep with the greeting that we 
were the fourteenth party she had turned away within the last 
hour and a half. As for our meek suggestions of stables, bil-
liard-room, or coal-cellars, she laughed them all to scorn: all 
these nooks had been snatched up long ago.

Did  she  know  of  any  place  in  the  whole  village  where  we 

could get shelter for the night?

“Well, if we didn’t mind roughing it — she did not recom-
mend  it,  mind — but  there  was  a  little  beershop  half  a  mile 
down the Eton road — ”

We waited to hear no more; we caught up the hamper and 
the bags, and the coats and rugs, and parcels, and ran. The dis-
tance seemed more like a mile than half a mile, but we reached 
the place at last, and rushed, panting, into the bar.

The people at the beershop were rude. They merely laughed 
at us. There were only three beds in the whole house, and they 
had seven single gentlemen and two married couples sleeping 
there  already. A  kind-hearted  bargeman,  however,  who  hap-
pened to be in the tap-room, thought we might try the grocer’s, 
next door to the Stag, and we went back.

The  grocer’s  was  full. An  old  woman  we  met  in  the  shop 

— 124 —

then kindly took us along with her for a quarter of a mile, to a 
lady friend of hers, who occasionally let rooms to gentlemen.
This  old  woman  walked  very  slowly,  and  we  were  twenty 
minutes getting to her lady friend’s. She enlivened the journey 
by describing to us, as we trailed along, the various pains she 
had in her back.

Her lady friend’s rooms were let. From there we were recom-
mended to No. 27. No. 27 was full, and sent us to No. 32, and 
32 was full.

Then we went back into the high road, and Harris sat down 
on  the  hamper  and  said  he  would  go  no  further.  He  said  it 
seemed  a  quiet  spot,  and  he  would  like  to  die  there.  He  re-
quested George and me to kiss his mother for him, and to tell 
all his relations that he forgave them and died happy.

At that moment an angel came by in the disguise of a small 
boy (and I cannot think of any more effective disguise an angel 
could have assumed), with a can of beer in one hand, and in 
the other something at the end of a string, which he let down 
on to every flat stone he came across, and then pulled up again, 
this producing a peculiarly unattractive sound, suggestive of 
suffering.

We  asked  this  heavenly  messenger  (as  we  discovered  him 
afterwards to be) if he knew of any lonely house, whose oc-
cupants  were  few  and  feeble  (old  ladies  or  paralysed gentle-
men  preferred),  who  could  be  easily  frightened  into  giving 
up their beds for the night to three desperate men; or, if not 
this, could he recommend us to an empty pigstye, or a disused 
limekiln, or anything of that sort. He did not know of any such 
place — at least, not one handy; but he said that, if we liked to 
come with him, his mother had a room to spare, and could put 
us up for the night.

We fell upon his neck there in the moonlight and blessed 
him, and it would have made a very beautiful picture if the boy 
himself had not been so over-powered by our emotion as to 
be unable to sustain himself under it, and sunk to the ground, 
letting us all down on top of him. Harris was so overcome with 

— 125 —

joy  that  he  fainted,  and  had  to  seize  the  boy’s  beer-can  and 
half empty it before he could recover consciousness, and then 
he started off at a run, and left George and me to bring on the 
luggage.

It was a little four-roomed cottage where the boy lived, and 
his mother — good soul! — gave us hot bacon for supper, and 
we  ate  it  all — five  pounds — and  a  jam  tart  afterwards,  and 
two pots of tea, and then we went to bed. There were two beds 
in the room; one was a 2ft. 6in. truckle bed, and George and 
I slept in that, and kept in by tying ourselves together with a 
sheet; and the other was the little boy’s bed, and Harris had 
that all to himself, and we found him, in the morning, with two 
feet of bare leg sticking out at the bottom, and George and I 
used it to hang the towels on while we bathed.

We were not so uppish about what sort of hotel we would 

have, next time we went to Datchet.

To  return  to  our  present  trip:  nothing  exciting  happened, 
and  we  tugged  steadily  on  to  a  little  below  Monkey  Island, 
where we drew up and lunched. We tackled the cold beef for 
lunch, and then we found that we had forgotten to bring any 
mustard. I don’t think I ever in my life, before or since, felt I 
wanted mustard as badly as I felt I wanted it then. I don’t care 
for mustard as a rule, and it is very seldom that I take it at all, 
but I would have given worlds for it then.

I don’t know how many worlds there may be in the universe, 
but anyone who had brought me a spoonful of mustard at that 
precise moment could have had them all. I grow reckless like 
that when I want a thing and can’t get it.

Harris said he would have given worlds for mustard too. It 
would have been a good thing for anybody who had come up 
to that spot with a can of mustard, then: he would have been 
set up in worlds for the rest of his life.

But there! I daresay both Harris and I would have tried to 
back  out  of  the  bargain  after  we  had  got  the  mustard.  One 
makes these extravagant offers in moments of excitement, but, 
of course, when one comes to think of it, one sees how absurd-

— 126 —

ly  out  of  proportion  they  are  with  the  value  of  the  required 
article.  I  heard  a  man,  going  up  a  mountain  in  Switzerland, 
once say he would give worlds for a glass of beer, and, when he 
came to a little shanty where they kept it, he kicked up a most 
fearful row because they charged him five francs for a bottle of 
Bass. He said it was a scandalous imposition, and he wrote to 
the Times about it.

It cast a gloom over the boat, there being no mustard. We ate 
our beef in silence. Existence seemed hollow and uninterest-
ing. We thought of the happy days of childhood, and sighed. 
We  brightened  up  a  bit,  however,  over  the  apple-tart,  and, 
when George drew out a tin of pine-apple from the bottom of 
the hamper, and rolled it into the middle of the boat, we felt 
that life was worth living after all.

We are very fond of pine-apple, all three of us. We looked 
at the picture on the tin; we thought of the juice. We smiled at 
one another, and Harris got a spoon ready.

Then  we  looked  for  the  knife  to  open  the  tin  with.  We 
turned out everything in the hamper. We turned out the bags. 
We pulled up the boards at the bottom of the boat. We took 
everything out on to the bank and shook it. There was no tin-
opener to be found.

Then Harris tried to open the tin with a pocket-knife, and 
broke the knife and cut himself badly; and George tried a pair 
of scissors, and the scissors flew up, and nearly put his eye out. 
While they were dressing their wounds, I tried to make a hole 
in the thing with the spiky end of the hitcher, and the hitcher 
slipped and jerked me out between the boat and the bank into 
two  feet  of  muddy  water,  and  the  tin  rolled  over,  uninjured, 
and broke a teacup.

Then we all got mad. We took that tin out on the bank, and 
Harris  went  up  into  a  field  and  got  a  big  sharp  stone,  and  I 
went back into the boat and brought out the mast, and George 
held the tin and Harris held the sharp end of his stone against 
the top of it, and I took the mast and poised it high up in the 
air, and gathered up all my strength and brought it down.

— 127 —

It was George’s straw hat that saved his life that day. He keeps 
that hat now (what is left of it), and, of a winter’s evening, when 
the pipes are lit and the boys are telling stretchers about the 
dangers they have passed through, George brings it down and 
shows it round, and the stirring tale is told anew, with fresh 
exaggerations every time.

Harris got off with merely a flesh wound.
After that, I took the tin off myself, and hammered at it with 
the mast till I was worn out and sick at heart, whereupon Har-
ris took it in hand.

We beat it out flat; we beat it back square; we battered it into 
every  form  known  to  geometry — but  we  could  not  make  a 
hole in it. Then George went at it, and knocked it into a shape, 
so strange, so weird, so unearthly in its wild hideousness, that 
he got frightened and threw away the mast. Then we all three 
sat round it on the grass and looked at it.

There was one great dent across the top that had the appear-
ance of a mocking grin, and it drove us furious, so that Harris 
rushed at the thing, and caught it up, and flung it far into the 
middle of the river, and as it sank we hurled our curses at it, 
and we got into the boat and rowed away from the spot, and 
never paused till we reached Maidenhead.

Maidenhead  itself  is  too  snobby  to  be  pleasant.  It  is  the 
haunt of the river swell and his overdressed female compan-
ion. It is the town of showy hotels, patronised chiefly by dudes 
and ballet girls. It is the witch’s kitchen from which go forth 
those demons of the river — steam-launches. The London Jour-
nal duke always has his “little place” at Maidenhead; and the 
heroine of the three-volume novel always dines there when she 
goes out on the spree with somebody else’s husband.

We  went  through  Maidenhead  quickly,  and  then  eased 
up, and took leisurely that grand reach beyond Boulter’s and 
Cookham locks. Clieveden Woods still wore their dainty dress 
of spring, and rose up, from the water’s edge, in one long har-
mony of blended shades of fairy green. In its unbroken loveli-
ness this is, perhaps, the sweetest stretch of all the river, and 

— 128 —

lingeringly we slowly drew our little boat away from its deep 
peace.

We  pulled  up  in  the  backwater,  just  below  Cookham,  and 
had tea; and, when we were through the lock, it was evening. 
A stiffish breeze had sprung up — in our favour, for a wonder; 
for, as a rule on the river, the wind is always dead against you 
whatever way you go. It is against you in the morning, when 
you start for a day’s trip, and you pull a long distance, thinking 
how easy it will be to come back with the sail. Then, after tea, 
the wind veers round, and you have to pull hard in its teeth all 
the way home.

When  you  forget  to  take  the  sail  at  all,  then  the  wind  is 
consistently in your favour both ways. But there! this world is 
only a probation, and man was born to trouble as the sparks 
fly upward.

This evening, however, they had evidently made a mistake, 
and had put the wind round at our back instead of in our face. 
We kept very quiet about it, and got the sail up quickly before 
they found it out, and then we spread ourselves about the boat 
in thoughtful attitudes, and the sail bellied out, and strained, 
and grumbled at the mast, and the boat flew.

I steered.
There is no more thrilling sensation I know of than sailing. 
It  comes  as  near  to  flying  as  man  has  got  to  yet — except  in 
dreams. The wings of the rushing wind seem to be bearing you 
onward, you know not where. You are no longer the slow, plod-
ding, puny thing of clay, creeping tortuously upon the ground; 
you are a part of Nature! Your heart is throbbing against hers! 
Her glorious arms are round you, raising you up against her 
heart! Your spirit is at one with hers; your limbs grow light! 
The voices of the air are singing to you. The earth seems far 
away and little; and the clouds, so close above your head, are 
brothers, and you stretch your arms to them.

We had the river to ourselves, except that, far in the distance, 
we could see a fishing-punt, moored in mid-stream, on which 

— 129 —

three  fishermen  sat;  and  we  skimmed  over  the  water,  and 
passed the wooded banks, and no one spoke.

I was steering.
As we drew nearer, we could see that the three men fishing 
seemed old and solemn-looking men. They sat on three chairs 
in the punt, and watched intently their lines. And the red sun-
set threw a mystic light upon the waters, and tinged with fire 
the towering woods, and made a golden glory of the piled-up 
clouds. It was an hour of deep enchantment, of ecstatic hope 
and longing. The little sail stood out against the purple sky, the 
gloaming lay around us, wrapping the world in rainbow shad-
ows; and, behind us, crept the night.

We seemed like knights of some old legend, sailing across 
some mystic lake into the unknown realm of twilight, unto the 
great land of the sunset.

We did not go into the realm of twilight; we went slap into 
that punt, where those three old men were fishing. We did not 
know what had happened at first, because the sail shut out the 
view, but from the nature of the language that rose up upon 
the evening air, we gathered that we had come into the neigh-
bourhood  of  human  beings,  and  that  they  were  vexed  and 
discontented.

Harris  let  the  sail  down,  and  then  we  saw  what  had  hap-
pened. We  had  knocked  those  three  old  gentlemen  off  their 
chairs  into  a  general  heap  at  the  bottom  of  the  boat,  and 
they  were  now  slowly  and  painfully  sorting  themselves  out 
from each other, and picking fish off themselves; and as they 
worked, they cursed us — not with a common cursory curse, 
but  with  long,  carefully-thought-out,  comprehensive  curses, 
that embraced the whole of our career, and went away into the 
distant future, and included all our relations, and covered eve-
rything connected with us — good, substantial curses.

Harris told them they ought to be grateful for a little excite-
ment, sitting there fishing all day, and he also said that he was 
shocked and grieved to hear men their age give way to temper 
so.

— 130 —

But it did not do any good.
George said he would steer, after that. He said a mind like 
mine ought not to be expected to give itself away in steering 
boats — better let a mere commonplace human being see after 
that boat, before we jolly well all got drowned; and he took the 
lines, and brought us up to Marlow.

And at Marlow we left the boat by the bridge, and went and 

put up for the night at the “Crown.”

MARLOW  is  one  of  the  pleasantest  river  centres  I  know  of. 
It is a bustling, lively little town; not very picturesque on the 
whole, it is true, but there are many quaint nooks and corners 
to be found in it, nevertheless — standing arches in the shat-
tered bridge of Time, over which our fancy travels back to the 
days when Marlow Manor owned Saxon Algar for its lord, ere 
conquering William seized it to give to Queen Matilda, ere it 
passed to the Earls of Warwick or to worldly-wise Lord Paget, 
the councillor of four successive sovereigns.

There is lovely country round about it, too, if, after boating, 
you are fond of a walk, while the river itself is at its best here. 
Down to Cookham, past the Quarry Woods and the meadows, 
is a lovely reach. Dear old Quarry Woods! with your narrow, 
climbing paths, and little winding glades, how scented to this 
hour you seem with memories of sunny summer days! How 
haunted are your shadowy vistas with the ghosts of laughing 
faces!  how  from  your  whispering  leaves  there  softly  fall  the 
voices of long ago!

From Marlow up to Sonning is even fairer yet. Grand old 
Bisham Abbey, whose stone walls have rung to the shouts of 
the Knights Templars, and which, at one time, was the home of 
Anne of Cleves and at another of Queen Elizabeth, is passed 
on  the  right  bank  just  half  a  mile  above  Marlow  Bridge.  Bi-
sham Abbey is rich in melodramatic properties. It contains a 
tapestry bed-chamber, and a secret room hid high up in the 
thick walls. The ghost of the Lady Holy, who beat her little boy 
to death, still walks there at night, trying to wash its ghostly 
hands clean in a ghostly basin.

— 132 —

Warwick,  the  king-maker,  rests  there,  careless  now  about 
such trivial things as earthly kings and earthly kingdoms; and 
Salisbury,  who  did  good  service  at  Poitiers.  Just  before  you 
come  to  the  abbey,  and  right  on  the  river’s  bank,  is  Bisham 
Church, and, perhaps, if any tombs are worth inspecting, they 
are the tombs and monuments in Bisham Church. It was while 
floating  in  his  boat  under  the  Bisham  beeches  that  Shelley, 
who was then living at Marlow (you can see his house now, in 
West street), composed The Revolt of Islam.

By Hurley Weir, a little higher up, I have often thought that I 
could stay a month without having sufficient time to drink in 
all the beauty of the scene. The village of Hurley, five minutes’ 
walk from the lock, is as old a little spot as there is on the river, 
dating, as it does, to quote the quaint phraseology of those dim 
days, “from the times of King Sebert and King Offa.” Just past 
the weir (going up) is Danes’ Field, where the invading Danes 
once encamped, during their march to Gloucestershire; and a 
little further still, nestling by a sweet corner of the stream, is 
what is left of Medmenham Abbey.

The  famous  Medmenham  monks,  or “Hell  Fire  Club,”  as 
they  were  commonly  called,  and  of  whom  the  notorious 
Wilkes  was  a  member,  were  a  fraternity  whose  motto  was 
“Do  as  you  please,”  and  that  invitation  still  stands  over  the 
ruined  doorway  of  the  abbey.  Many  years  before  this  bogus 
abbey, with its congregation of irreverent jesters, was founded, 
there stood upon this same spot a monastery of a sterner kind, 
whose monks were of a somewhat different type to the revel-
lers that were to follow them, five hundred years afterwards.

The Cistercian monks, whose abbey stood there in the thir-
teenth  century,  wore  no  clothes  but  rough  tunics  and  cowls, 
and ate no flesh, nor fish, nor eggs. They lay upon straw, and 
they rose at midnight to mass. They spent the day in labour, 
reading, and prayer; and over all their lives there fell a silence 
as of death, for no one spoke.

A  grim  fraternity,  passing  grim  lives  in  that  sweet  spot, 
that God had made so bright! Strange that Nature’s voices all 

— 133 —

around them — the soft singing of the waters, the whisperings 
of  the  river  grass,  the  music  of  the  rushing  wind — should 
not have taught them a truer meaning of life than this. They 
listened there, through the long days, in silence, waiting for a 
voice from heaven; and all day long and through the solemn 
night it spoke to them in myriad tones, and they heard it not.
From Medmenham to sweet Hambledon Lock the river is 
full of peaceful beauty, but, after it passes Greenlands, the rath-
er uninteresting looking river residence of my newsagent — a 
quiet unassuming old gentleman, who may often be met with 
about these regions, during the summer months, sculling him-
self along in easy vigorous style, or chatting genially to some 
old  lock-keeper,  as  he  passes  through — until  well  the  other 
side of Henley, it is somewhat bare and dull.

We got up tolerably early on the Monday morning at Mar-
low, and went for a bathe before breakfast; and, coming back, 
Montmorency made an awful ass of himself. The only subject 
on which Montmorency and I have any serious difference of 
opinion is cats. I like cats; Montmorency does not.

When I meet a cat, I say, “Poor Pussy!” and stop down and 
tickle the side of its head; and the cat sticks up its tail in a rigid, 
cast-iron manner, arches its back, and wipes its nose up against 
my trousers; and all is gentleness and peace. When Montmor-
ency meets a cat, the whole street knows about it; and there is 
enough bad language wasted in ten seconds to last an ordinar-
ily respectable man all his life, with care.

I do not blame the dog (contenting myself, as a rule, with 
merely clouting his head or throwing stones at him), because 
I take it that it is his nature. Fox-terriers are born with about 
four times as much original sin in them as other dogs are, and 
it will take years and years of patient effort on the part of us 
Christians to bring about any appreciable reformation in the 
rowdiness of the fox-terrier nature.

I remember being in the lobby of the Haymarket Stores one 
day, and all round about me were dogs, waiting for the return 
of their owners, who were shopping inside. There were a mas-

— 134 —

tiff, and one or two collies, and a St. Bernard, a few retrievers 
and  Newfoundlands,  a  boar-hound,  a  French  poodle,  with 
plenty of hair round its head, but mangy about the middle; a 
bull-dog, a few Lowther Arcade sort of animals, about the size 
of rats, and a couple of Yorkshire tykes.

There  they  sat,  patient,  good,  and  thoughtful.  A  solemn 
peacefulness seemed to reign in that lobby. An air of calmness 
and resignation — of gentle sadness pervaded the room.

Then a sweet young lady entered, leading a meek-looking 
little fox-terrier, and left him, chained up there, between the 
bull-dog and the poodle. He sat and looked about him for a 
minute. Then he cast up his eyes to the ceiling, and seemed, 
judging  from  his  expression,  to  be  thinking  of  his  mother. 
Then he yawned. Then he looked round at the other dogs, all 
silent, grave, and dignified.

He looked at the bull-dog, sleeping dreamlessly on his right. 
He looked at the poodle, erect and haughty, on his left. Then, 
without a word of warning, without the shadow of a provoca-
tion, he bit that poodle’s near fore-leg, and a yelp of agony rang 
through the quiet shades of that lobby.

The result of his first experiment seemed highly satisfactory 
to him, and he determined to go on and make things lively all 
round. He sprang over the poodle and vigorously attacked a 
collie,  and  the  collie  woke  up,  and  immediately  commenced 
a fierce and noisy contest with the poodle. Then Foxey came 
back to his own place, and caught the bull-dog by the ear, and 
tried to throw him away; and the bull-dog, a curiously impar-
tial animal, went for everything he could reach, including the 
hall-porter, which gave that dear little terrier the opportunity 
to  enjoy  an  uninterrupted  fight  of  his  own  with  an  equally 
willing Yorkshire tyke.

Anyone who knows canine nature need hardly be told that, 
by this time, all the other dogs in the place were fighting as if 
their hearths and homes depended on the fray. The big dogs 
fought each other indiscriminately; and the little dogs fought 

— 135 —

among themselves, and filled up their spare time by biting the 
legs of the big dogs.

The whole lobby was a perfect pandemonium, and the din 
was terrific. A crowd assembled outside in the Haymarket, and 
asked if it was a vestry meeting; or, if not, who was being mur-
dered, and why? Men came with poles and ropes, and tried to 
separate the dogs, and the police were sent for.

And in the midst of the riot that sweet young lady returned, 
and snatched up that sweet little dog of hers (he had laid the 
tyke up for a month, and had on the expression, now, of a new-
born lamb) into her arms, and kissed him, and asked him if he 
was killed, and what those great nasty brutes of dogs had been 
doing to him; and he nestled up against her, and gazed up into 
her face with a look that seemed to say: “Oh, I’m so glad you’ve 
come to take me away from this disgraceful scene!”

She  said  that  the  people  at  the  Stores  had  no  right  to  al-
low great savage things like those other dogs to be put with 
respectable  people’s  dogs,  and  that  she  had  a  great  mind  to 
summon somebody.

Such  is  the  nature  of  fox-terriers;  and,  therefore,  I  do  not 
blame Montmorency for his tendency to row with cats; but he 
wished he had not given way to it that morning.

We were, as I have said, returning from a dip, and half-way 
up the High Street a cat darted out from one of the houses in 
front of us, and began to trot across the road. Montmorency 
gave a cry of joy — the cry of a stern warrior who sees his en-
emy given over to his hands — the sort of cry Cromwell might 
have  uttered  when  the  Scots  came  down  the  hill — and  flew 
after his prey.

His victim was a large black Tom. I never saw a larger cat, 
nor  a  more  disreputable-looking  cat.  It  had  lost  half  its  tail, 
one of its ears, and a fairly appreciable proportion of its nose. 
It was a long, sinewy-looking animal. It had a calm, contented 
air about it.

Montmorency went for that poor cat at the rate of twenty 
miles an hour; but the cat did not hurry up — did not seem to 

— 136 —

have grasped the idea that its life was in danger. It trotted qui-
etly on until its would-be assassin was within a yard of it, and 
then it turned round and sat down in the middle of the road, 
and looked at Montmorency with a gentle, inquiring expres-
sion, that said:

“Yes! You want me?”
Montmorency does not lack pluck; but there was something 
about the look of that cat that might have chilled the heart of 
the boldest dog. He stopped abruptly, and looked back at Tom.
Neither spoke; but the conversation that one could imagine 

was clearly as follows: —
THE CAT: “Can I do anything for you?”
MONTMORENCY: “No — no, thanks.”
THE CAT: “Don’t you mind speaking, if you really want any-

thing, you know.”

MONTMORENCY (backing down the High Street): “Oh, no — 
not at all — certainly — don’t you trouble. I — I am afraid I’ve 
made  a  mistake.  I  thought  I  knew  you.  Sorry  I  disturbed 
you.”

THE CAT: “Not at all — quite a pleasure. Sure you don’t want 

anything, now?”

MONTMORENCY (still backing): “Not at all, thanks — not at 

all — very kind of you. Good-morning.”

THE CAT: “Good-morning.”

Then  the  cat  rose,  and  continued  his  trot;  and  Montmor-
ency, fitting what he calls his tail carefully into its groove, came 
back to us, and took up an unimportant position in the rear.

To this day, if you say the word “Cats!” to Montmorency, he 

will visibly shrink and look up piteously at you, as if to say:

“Please don’t.”
We did our marketing after breakfast, and revictualled the 
boat for three days. George said we ought to take vegetables — 
that it was unhealthy not to eat vegetables. He said they were 
easy enough to cook, and that he would see to that; so we got 
ten pounds of potatoes, a bushel of peas, and a few cabbages. 
We got a beefsteak pie, a couple of gooseberry tarts, and a leg 

— 137 —

of mutton from the hotel; and fruit, and cakes, and bread and 
butter, and jam, and bacon and eggs, and other things we for-
aged round about the town for.

Our departure from Marlow I regard as one of our great-
est  successes.  It  was  dignified  and  impressive,  without  being 
ostentatious. We had insisted at all the shops we had been to 
that the things should be sent with us then and there. None 
of your “Yes, sir, I will send them off at once: the boy will be 
down there before you are, sir!” and then fooling about on the 
landing-stage, and going back to the shop twice to have a row 
about them, for us. We waited while the basket was packed, and 
took the boy with us.

We went to a good many shops, adopting this principle at 
each one; and the consequence was that, by the time we had 
finished, we had as fine a collection of boys with baskets fol-
lowing us around as heart could desire; and our final march 
down  the  middle  of  the  High  Street,  to  the  river,  must  have 
been as imposing a spectacle as Marlow had seen for many a 
long day.

The order of the procession was as follows: —

Montmorency, carrying a stick.

Two disreputable-looking curs, friends of Montmorency’s.
George, carrying coats and rugs, and smoking a short pipe.

Harris, trying to walk with easy grace, while carrying

a bulged-out Gladstone bag in one hand and

a bottle of lime-juice in the other.

Greengrocer’s boy and baker’s boy, with baskets.

Boots from the hotel, carrying hamper.

Confectioner’s boy, with basket.

Grocer’s boy, with basket.

Long-haired dog.

Cheesemonger’s boy, with basket.

Odd man carrying a bag.

Bosom companion of odd man, with his hands

in his pockets, smoking a short clay.

— 138 —

Fruiterer’s boy, with basket.

Myself, carrying three hats and a pair of boots,

and trying to look as if I didn’t know it.

Six small boys, and four stray dogs.

When we got down to the landing-stage, the boatman said:
“Let  me  see,  sir;  was  yours  a  steam-launch  or  a  house-

On  our  informing  him  it  was  a  double-sculling  skiff,  he 

boat?”

seemed surprised.

We  had  a  good  deal  of  trouble  with  steam  launches  that 
morning.  It  was  just  before  the  Henley  week,  and  they  were 
going up in large numbers; some by themselves, some towing 
houseboats. I do hate steam launches: I suppose every rowing 
man does. I never see a steam launch but I feel I should like to 
lure it to a lonely part of the river, and there, in the silence and 
the solitude, strangle it.

There is a blatant bumptiousness about a steam launch that 
has the knack of rousing every evil instinct in my nature, and 
I yearn for the good old days, when you could go about and 
tell people what you thought of them with a hatchet and a bow 
and arrows. The expression on the face of the man who, with 
his hands in his pockets, stands by the stern, smoking a cigar, 
is sufficient to excuse a breach of the peace by itself; and the 
lordly whistle for you to get out of the way would, I am confi-
dent, ensure a verdict of “justifiable homicide” from any jury 
of river men.

They used to have to whistle for us to get out of their way. If 
I may do so, without appearing boastful, I think I can honestly 
say  that  our  one  small  boat,  during  that  week,  caused  more 
annoyance and delay and aggravation to the steam launches 
that we came across than all the other craft on the river put 
together.

“Steam launch, coming!” one of us would cry out, on sight-
ing the enemy in the distance; and, in an instant, everything 
was got ready to receive her. I would take the lines, and Harris 

— 139 —

and George would sit down beside me, all of us with our backs 
to the launch, and the boat would drift out quietly into mid-
stream.

On would come the launch, whistling, and on we would go, 
drifting. At about a hundred yards off, she would start whis-
tling like mad, and the people would come and lean over the 
side, and roar at us; but we never heard them! Harris would 
be telling us an anecdote about his mother, and George and I 
would not have missed a word of it for worlds.

Then that launch would give one final shriek of a whistle 
that  would  nearly  burst  the  boiler,  and  she  would  reverse 
her  engines,  and  blow  off  steam,  and  swing  round  and  get 
aground; everyone on board of it would rush to the bow and 
yell at us, and the people on the bank would stand and shout to 
us, and all the other passing boats would stop and join in, till 
the whole river for miles up and down was in a state of frantic 
commotion. And then Harris would break off in the most in-
teresting part of his narrative, and look up with mild surprise, 
and say to George:

“Why, George, bless me, if here isn’t a steam launch!”
And George would answer:
“Well, do you know, I thought I heard something!”
Upon which we would get nervous and confused, and not 
know how to get the boat out of the way, and the people in the 
launch would crowd round and instruct us:

“Pull your right — you, you idiot! back with your left. No, 
not  you — the  other  one — leave  the  lines  alone,  can’t  you — 
now, both together. NOT that way. Oh, you — !”

Then they would lower a boat and come to our assistance; 
and, after quarter of an hour’s effort, would get us clean out of 
their way, so that they could go on; and we would thank them 
so much, and ask them to give us a tow. But they never would.
Another good way we discovered of irritating the aristocrat-
ic type of steam launch, was to mistake them for a beanfeast, 
and ask them if they were Messrs. Cubit’s lot or the Bermond-
sey Good Templars, and could they lend us a saucepan.

— 140 —

Old ladies, not accustomed to the river, are always intensely 
nervous of steam launches. I remember going up once from 
Staines to Windsor — a stretch of water peculiarly rich in these 
mechanical  monstrosities — with  a  party  containing  three 
ladies  of  this  description.  It  was  very  exciting.  At  the  first 
glimpse of every steam launch that came in view, they insisted 
on landing and sitting down on the bank until it was out of 
sight again. They said they were very sorry, but that they owed 
it to their families not to be fool-hardy.

We found ourselves short of water at Hambledon Lock; so 
we took our jar and went up to the lock-keeper’s house to beg 
for some.

George was our spokesman. He put on a winning smile, and 

said:

“Oh, please could you spare us a little water?”
“Certainly,” replied the old gentleman; “take as much as you 

want, and leave the rest.”

“Thank  you  so  much,”  murmured  George,  looking  about 

him. “Where — where do you keep it?”

“It’s always in the same place my boy,” was the stolid reply: 

“just behind you.”

“I don’t see it,” said George, turning round.
“Why, bless us, where’s your eyes?” was the man’s comment, 
as  he  twisted  George  round  and  pointed  up  and  down  the 
stream. “There’s enough of it to see, ain’t there?”

“Oh!”  exclaimed  George,  grasping  the  idea; “but  we  can’t 

drink the river, you know!”

“No; but you can drink some of it,” replied the old fellow. 

“It’s what I’ve drunk for the last fifteen years.”

George told him that his appearance, after the course, did 
not seem a sufficiently good advertisement for the brand; and 
that he would prefer it out of a pump.

We got some from a cottage a little higher up. I daresay that 
was only river water, if we had known. But we did not know, 
so it was all right. What the eye does not see, the stomach does 
not get upset over.

— 141 —

We tried river water once, later on in the season, but it was 
not a success. We were coming down stream, and had pulled 
up to have tea in a backwater near Windsor. Our jar was empty, 
and it was a case of going without our tea or taking water from 
the river. Harris was for chancing it. He said it must be all right 
if we boiled the water. He said that the various germs of poison 
present in the water would be killed by the boiling. So we filled 
our kettle with Thames backwater, and boiled it; and very care-
ful we were to see that it did boil.

We had made the tea, and were just settling down comfort-
ably to drink it, when George, with his cup half-way to his lips, 
paused and exclaimed:

“What’s that?”
“What’s what?” asked Harris and I.
“Why that!” said George, looking westward.
Harris and I followed his gaze, and saw, coming down to-
wards us on the sluggish current, a dog. It was one of the qui-
etest and peacefullest dogs I have ever seen. I never met a dog 
who seemed more contented — more easy in its mind. It was 
floating dreamily on its back, with its four legs stuck up straight 
into the air. It was what I should call a full-bodied dog, with a 
well-developed chest. On he came, serene, dignified, and calm, 
until he was abreast of our boat, and there, among the rushes, 
he eased up, and settled down cosily for the evening.

George said he didn’t want any tea, and emptied his cup into 
the water. Harris did not feel thirsty, either, and followed suit. I 
had drunk half mine, but I wished I had not.

I asked George if he thought I was likely to have typhoid.
He  said: “Oh,  no;”  he  thought  I  had  a  very  good  chance 
indeed of escaping it. Anyhow, I should know in about a fort-
night, whether I had or had not.

We went up the backwater to Wargrave. It is a short cut, lead-
ing out of the right-hand bank about half a mile above Marsh 
Lock, and is well worth taking, being a pretty, shady little piece 
of stream, besides saving nearly half a mile of distance.

Of course, its entrance is studded with posts and chains, and 

— 142 —

surrounded with notice boards, menacing all kinds of torture, 
imprisonment, and death to everyone who dares set scull upon 
its waters — I wonder some of these riparian boors don’t claim 
the air of the river and threaten everyone with forty shillings 
fine who breathes it — but the posts and chains a little skill will 
easily avoid; and as for the boards, you might, if you have five 
minutes to spare, and there is nobody about, take one or two of 
them down and throw them into the river.

Half-way up the backwater, we got out and lunched; and it 
was during this lunch that George and I received rather a try-
ing shock.

Harris  received  a  shock,  too;  but  I  do  not  think  Harris’s 
shock could have been anything like so bad as the shock that 
George and I had over the business.

You  see,  it  was  in  this  way:  we  were  sitting  in  a  meadow, 
about  ten  yards  from  the  water’s  edge,  and  we  had  just  set-
tled  down  comfortably  to  feed.  Harris  had  the  beefsteak  pie 
between his knees, and was carving it, and George and I were 
waiting with our plates ready.

“Have you got a spoon there?” says Harris; “I want a spoon 

to help the gravy with.”

The  hamper  was  close  behind  us,  and  George  and  I  both 
turned round to reach one out. We were not five seconds get-
ting it. When we looked round again, Harris and the pie were 
gone!

It was a wide, open field. There was not a tree or a bit of 
hedge for hundreds of yards. He could not have tumbled into 
the  river,  because  we  were  on  the  water  side  of  him,  and  he 
would have had to climb over us to do it.

George and I gazed all about. Then we gazed at each other.
“Has he been snatched up to heaven?” I queried.
“They’d hardly have taken the pie too,” said George.
There seemed weight in this objection, and we discarded the 

heavenly theory.

“I suppose the truth of the matter is,” suggested George, de-

— 143 —

scending to the commonplace and practicable, “that there has 
been an earthquake.”

And then he added, with a touch of sadness in his voice: “I 

wish he hadn’t been carving that pie.”

With a sigh, we turned our eyes once more towards the spot 
where  Harris  and  the  pie  had  last  been  seen  on  earth;  and 
there, as our blood froze in our veins and our hair stood up on 
end, we saw Harris’s head — and nothing but his head — stick-
ing  bolt  upright  among  the  tall  grass,  the  face  very  red,  and 
bearing upon it an expression of great indignation!

George was the first to recover.
“Speak!”  he  cried,  “and  tell  us  whether  you  are  alive  or 

dead — and where is the rest of you?”

“Oh, don’t be a stupid ass!” said Harris’s head. “I believe you 

did it on purpose.”

“Did what?” exclaimed George and I.
“Why, put me to sit here — darn silly trick! Here, catch hold 

of the pie.”

And out of the middle of the earth, as it seemed to us, rose 
the  pie — very  much  mixed  up  and  damaged;  and,  after  it, 
scrambled Harris — tumbled, grubby, and wet.

He had been sitting, without knowing it, on the very verge of 
a small gully, the long grass hiding it from view; and in leaning 
a little back he had shot over, pie and all.

He said he had never felt so surprised in all his life, as when 
he first felt himself going, without being able to conjecture in 
the slightest what had happened. He thought at first that the 
end of the world had come.

Harris believes to this day that George and I planned it all 
beforehand. Thus does unjust suspicion follow even the most 
blameless for, as the poet says, “Who shall escape calumny?”

Who, indeed!

CHAPTER XIV.

Wargrave.  —  Waxworks.  —  Sonning.  —  Our  stew.  —  Montmor-
ency is sarcastic. — Fight between Montmorency and the tea-ket-
tle. — George’s banjo studies. — Meet with discouragement. — Dif-
ficulties in the way of the musical amateur. — Learning to play the

a troubled night.

WE caught a breeze, after lunch, which took us gently up past 
Wargrave and Shiplake. Mellowed in the drowsy sunlight of a 
summer’s afternoon, Wargrave, nestling where the river bends, 
makes a sweet old picture as you pass it, and one that lingers 
long upon the retina of memory.

The “George and Dragon” at Wargrave boasts a sign, painted 
on the one side by Leslie, R.A., and on the other by Hodgson of 
that ilk. Leslie has depicted the fight; Hodgson has imagined 
the scene, “After the Fight” — George, the work done, enjoying 
his pint of beer.

Day, the author of Sandford and Merton, lived and — more 
credit to the place still — was killed at Wargrave. In the church 
is  a  memorial  to  Mrs.  Sarah  Hill,  who  bequeathed  1  pound 
annually, to be divided at Easter, between two boys and two 
girls  who “have  never  been  undutiful  to  their  parents;  who 
have never been known to swear or to tell untruths, to steal, or 
to break windows.” Fancy giving up all that for five shillings a 
year! It is not worth it.

It is rumoured in the town that once, many years ago, a boy 
appeared  who  really  never  had  done  these  things — or  at  all 
events, which was all that was required or could be expected, 
had never been known to do them — and thus won the crown 
of glory. He was exhibited for three weeks afterwards in the 
Town Hall, under a glass case.

What has become of the money since no one knows. They 

say it is always handed over to the nearest wax-works show.

Shiplake is a pretty village, but it cannot be seen from the 

— 145 —

river, being upon the hill. Tennyson was married in Shiplake 
Church.

The  river  up  to  Sonning  winds  in  and  out  through  many 
islands, and is very placid, hushed, and lonely. Few folk, except 
at twilight, a pair or two of rustic lovers, walk along its banks. 
’Arry  and  Lord  Fitznoodle  have  been  left  behind  at  Henley, 
and dismal, dirty Reading is not yet reached. It is a part of the 
river in which to dream of bygone days, and vanished forms 
and faces, and things that might have been, but are not, con-
found them.

We got out at Sonning, and went for a walk round the vil-
lage. It is the most fairy-like little nook on the whole river. It 
is more like a stage village than one built of bricks and mortar. 
Every  house  is  smothered  in  roses,  and  now,  in  early  June, 
they were bursting forth in clouds of dainty splendour. If you 
stop at Sonning, put up at the “Bull,” behind the church. It is 
a veritable picture of an old country inn, with green, square 
courtyard in front, where, on seats beneath the trees, the old 
men  group  of  an  evening  to  drink  their  ale  and  gossip  over 
village politics; with low, quaint rooms and latticed windows, 
and awkward stairs and winding passages.

We roamed about sweet Sonning for an hour or so, and then, 
it being too late to push on past Reading, we decided to go back 
to one of the Shiplake islands, and put up there for the night. It 
was still early when we got settled, and George said that, as we 
had plenty of time, it would be a splendid opportunity to try 
a good, slap-up supper. He said he would show us what could 
be done up the river in the way of cooking, and suggested that, 
with the vegetables and the remains of the cold beef and gen-
eral odds and ends, we should make an Irish stew.

It  seemed  a  fascinating  idea.  George  gathered  wood  and 
made  a  fire,  and  Harris  and  I  started  to  peel  the  potatoes.  I 
should never have thought that peeling potatoes was such an 
undertaking. The job turned out to be the biggest thing of its 
kind that I had ever been in. We began cheerfully, one might 
almost  say  skittishly,  but  our  light-heartedness  was  gone  by 

— 146 —

the time the first potato was finished. The more we peeled, the 
more peel there seemed to be left on; by the time we had got 
all the peel off and all the eyes out, there was no potato left — at 
least none worth speaking of. George came and had a look at 
it — it was about the size of a pea-nut. He said:

“Oh, that won’t do! You’re wasting them. You must scrape 

them.”

So we scraped them, and that was harder work than peeling. 
They  are  such  an  extraordinary  shape,  potatoes — all  bumps 
and warts and hollows. We worked steadily for five-and-twen-
ty minutes, and did four potatoes. Then we struck. We said we 
should require the rest of the evening for scraping ourselves.

I  never  saw  such  a  thing  as  potato-scraping  for  making  a 
fellow in a mess. It seemed difficult to believe that the potato-
scrapings in which Harris and I stood, half smothered, could 
have come off four potatoes. It shows you what can be done 
with economy and care.

George said it was absurd to have only four potatoes in an 
Irish  stew,  so  we  washed  half-a-dozen  or  so  more,  and  put 
them in without peeling. We also put in a cabbage and about 
half a peck of peas. George stirred it all up, and then he said 
that  there  seemed  to  be  a  lot  of  room  to  spare,  so  we  over-
hauled both the hampers, and picked out all the odds and ends 
and the remnants, and added them to the stew. There were half 
a pork pie and a bit of cold boiled bacon left, and we put them 
in.  Then  George  found  half  a  tin  of  potted  salmon,  and  he 
emptied that into the pot.

He said that was the advantage of Irish stew: you got rid of 
such a lot of things. I fished out a couple of eggs that had got 
cracked, and put those in. George said they would thicken the 
gravy.

I  forget  the  other  ingredients,  but  I  know  nothing  was 
wasted; and I remember that, towards the end, Montmorency, 
who had evinced great interest in the proceedings throughout, 
strolled away with an earnest and thoughtful air, reappearing, 
a few minutes afterwards, with a dead water-rat in his mouth, 

— 147 —

which he evidently wished to present as his contribution to the 
dinner; whether in a sarcastic spirit, or with a genuine desire 
to assist, I cannot say.

We had a discussion as to whether the rat should go in or 
not. Harris said that he thought it would be all right, mixed up 
with the other things, and that every little helped; but George 
stood up for precedent. He said he had never heard of water-
rats in Irish stew, and he would rather be on the safe side, and 
not try experiments.

Harris said:
“If you never try a new thing, how can you tell what it’s like? 
It’s men such as you that hamper the world’s progress. Think of 
the man who first tried German sausage!”

It was a great success, that Irish stew. I don’t think I ever en-
joyed a meal more. There was something so fresh and piquant 
about it. One’s palate gets so tired of the old hackneyed things: 
here was a dish with a new flavour, with a taste like nothing 
else on earth.

And it was nourishing, too. As George said, there was good 
stuff in it. The peas and potatoes might have been a bit softer, 
but we all had good teeth, so that did not matter much: and as 
for the gravy, it was a poem — a little too rich, perhaps, for a 
weak stomach, but nutritious.

We finished up with tea and cherry tart. Montmorency had 
a  fight  with  the  kettle  during  tea-time,  and  came  off  a  poor 
second.

Throughout the trip, he had manifested great curiosity con-
cerning the kettle. He would sit and watch it, as it boiled, with a 
puzzled expression, and would try and rouse it every now and 
then by growling at it. When it began to splutter and steam, he 
regarded it as a challenge, and would want to fight it, only, at 
that precise moment, some one would always dash up and bear 
off his prey before he could get at it.

To-day he determined he would be beforehand. At the first 
sound  the  kettle  made,  he  rose,  growling,  and  advanced  to-

— 148 —

wards it in a threatening attitude. It was only a little kettle, but 
it was full of pluck, and it up and spit at him.

“Ah! would ye!” growled Montmorency, showing his teeth; 
“I’ll teach ye to cheek a hard-working, respectable dog; ye mis-
erable, long-nosed, dirty-looking scoundrel, ye. Come on!”

And he rushed at that poor little kettle, and seized it by the 

spout.

Then,  across  the  evening  stillness,  broke  a  blood-curdling 
yelp, and Montmorency left the boat, and did a constitutional 
three times round the island at the rate of thirty-five miles an 
hour, stopping every now and then to bury his nose in a bit of 
cool mud.

From that day Montmorency regarded the kettle with a mix-
ture of awe, suspicion, and hate. Whenever he saw it he would 
growl and back at a rapid rate, with his tail shut down, and the 
moment it was put upon the stove he would promptly climb 
out of the boat, and sit on the bank, till the whole tea business 
was over.

George got out his banjo after supper, and wanted to play 
it, but Harris objected: he said he had got a headache, and did 
not feel strong enough to stand it. George thought the music 
might do him good — said music often soothed the nerves and 
took away a headache; and he twanged two or three notes, just 
to show Harris what it was like.

Harris said he would rather have the headache.
George has never learned to play the banjo to this day. He 
has had too much all-round discouragement to meet. He tried 
on two or three evenings, while we were up the river, to get a 
little practice, but it was never a success. Harris’s language used 
to be enough to unnerve any man; added to which, Montmor-
ency would sit and howl steadily, right through the perform-
ance. It was not giving the man a fair chance.

“What’s  he  want  to  howl  like  that  for  when  I’m  playing?” 
George  would  exclaim  indignantly,  while  taking  aim  at  him 
with a boot.

“What do you want to play like that for when he is howl-

— 149 —

ing?”  Harris  would  retort,  catching  the  boot.  “You  let  him 
alone. He can’t help howling. He’s got a musical ear, and your 
playing makes him howl.”

So George determined to postpone study of the banjo until 
he reached home. But he did not get much opportunity even 
there. Mrs. P. used to come up and say she was very sorry — for 
herself, she liked to hear him — but the lady upstairs was in a 
very delicate state, and the doctor was afraid it might injure 
the child.

Then George tried taking it out with him late at night, and 
practising round the square. But the inhabitants complained to 
the police about it, and a watch was set for him one night, and 
he was captured. The evidence against him was very clear, and 
he was bound over to keep the peace for six months.

He seemed to lose heart in the business after that. He did 
make one or two feeble efforts to take up the work again when 
the  six  months  had  elapsed,  but  there  was  always  the  same 
coldness — the same want of sympathy on the part of the world 
to fight against; and, after awhile, he despaired altogether, and 
advertised the instrument for sale at a great sacrifice — “owner 
having no further use for same” — and took to learning card 
tricks instead.

It  must  be  disheartening  work  learning  a  musical  instru-
ment. You would think that Society, for its own sake, would do 
all it could to assist a man to acquire the art of playing a musi-
cal instrument. But it doesn’t!

I knew a young fellow once, who was studying to play the 
bagpipes, and you would be surprised at the amount of opposi-
tion he had to contend with. Why, not even from the members 
of  his  own  family  did  he  receive  what  you  could  call  active 
encouragement. His father was dead against the business from 
the beginning, and spoke quite unfeelingly on the subject.

My friend used to get up early in the morning to practise, 
but he had to give that plan up, because of his sister. She was 
somewhat religiously inclined, and she said it seemed such an 
awful thing to begin the day like that.

— 150 —

So he sat up at night instead, and played after the family had 
gone to bed, but that did not do, as it got the house such a bad 
name.  People,  going  home  late,  would  stop  outside  to  listen, 
and then put it about all over the town, the next morning, that 
a  fearful  murder  had  been  committed  at  Mr.  Jefferson’s  the 
night before; and would describe how they had heard the vic-
tim’s shrieks and the brutal oaths and curses of the murderer, 
followed by the prayer for mercy, and the last dying gurgle of 
the corpse.

So they let him practise in the day-time, in the back-kitchen 
with all the doors shut; but his more successful passages could 
generally be heard in the sitting-room, in spite of these precau-
tions, and would affect his mother almost to tears.

She said it put her in mind of her poor father (he had been 
swallowed by a shark, poor man, while bathing off the coast of 
New Guinea — where the connection came in, she could not 
explain).

Then they knocked up a little place for him at the bottom 
of  the  garden,  about  quarter  of  a  mile  from  the  house,  and 
made him take the machine down there when he wanted to 
work it; and sometimes a visitor would come to the house who 
knew nothing of the matter, and they would forget to tell him 
all about it, and caution him, and he would go out for a stroll 
round  the  garden  and  suddenly  get  within  earshot  of  those 
bagpipes,  without  being  prepared  for  it,  or  knowing  what  it 
was. If he were a man of strong mind, it only gave him fits; but 
a person of mere average intellect it usually sent mad.

There is, it must be confessed, something very sad about the 
early efforts of an amateur in bagpipes. I have felt that myself 
when listening to my young friend. They appear to be a trying 
instrument to perform upon. You have to get enough breath 
for  the  whole  tune  before  you  start — at  least,  so  I  gathered 
from watching Jefferson.

He  would  begin  magnificently  with  a  wild,  full,  come-to-
the-battle sort of a note, that quite roused you. But he would 

— 151 —

get more and more piano as he went on, and the last verse gen-
erally collapsed in the middle with a splutter and a hiss.

You want to be in good health to play the bagpipes.
Young  Jefferson  only  learnt  to  play  one  tune  on  those 
bagpipes; but I never heard any complaints about the insuf-
ficiency of his repertoire — none whatever. This tune was “The 
Campbells are Coming, Hooray — Hooray!” so he said, though 
his father always held that it was “The Blue Bells of Scotland.” 
Nobody  seemed  quite  sure  what  it  was  exactly,  but  they  all 
agreed that it sounded Scotch.

Strangers  were  allowed  three  guesses,  and  most  of  them 

guessed a different tune each time.

Harris was disagreeable after supper, — I think it must have 
been the stew that had upset him: he is not used to high liv-
ing, — so George and I left him in the boat, and settled to go 
for a mouch round Henley. He said he should have a glass of 
whisky  and  a  pipe,  and  fix  things  up  for  the  night. We  were 
to shout when we returned, and he would row over from the 
island and fetch us.

“Don’t go to sleep, old man,” we said as we started.
“Not much fear of that while this stew’s on,” he grunted, as 

he pulled back to the island.

Henley was getting ready for the regatta, and was full of bus-
tle. We met a goodish number of men we knew about the town, 
and in their pleasant company the time slipped by somewhat 
quickly; so that it was nearly eleven o’clock before we set off on 
our four-mile walk home — as we had learned to call our little 
craft by this time.

It was a dismal night, coldish, with a thin rain falling; and as 
we trudged through the dark, silent fields, talking low to each 
other, and wondering if we were going right or not, we thought 
of the cosy boat, with the bright light streaming through the 
tight-drawn  canvas;  of  Harris  and  Montmorency,  and  the 
whisky, and wished that we were there.

We  conjured  up  the  picture  of  ourselves  inside,  tired  and 
a  little  hungry;  of  the  gloomy  river  and  the  shapeless  trees; 

— 152 —

and,  like  a  giant  glow-worm  underneath  them,  our  dear  old 
boat, so snug and warm and cheerful. We could see ourselves 
at supper there, pecking away at cold meat, and passing each 
other chunks of bread; we could hear the cheery clatter of our 
knives, the laughing voices, filling all the space, and overflow-
ing through the opening out into the night. And we hurried on 
to realise the vision.

We struck the tow-path at length, and that made us happy; 
because prior to this we had not been sure whether we were 
walking towards the river or away from it, and when you are 
tired and want to go to bed uncertainties like that worry you. 
We  passed  Skiplake  as  the  clock  was  striking  the  quarter  to 
twelve; and then George said, thoughtfully:

“You don’t happen to remember which of the islands it was, 

“No,” I replied, beginning to grow thoughtful too, “I don’t. 

How many are there?”

“Only  four,”  answered  George. “It  will  be  all  right,  if  he’s 

“And  if  not?”  I  queried;  but  we  dismissed  that  train  of 

do you?”

awake.”

thought.

We  shouted  when  we  came  opposite  the  first  island,  but 
there  was  no  response;  so  we  went  to  the  second,  and  tried 
there, and obtained the same result.

“Oh! I remember now,” said George; “it was the third one.”
And we ran on hopefully to the third one, and hallooed.
No answer!
The case was becoming serious. It was now past midnight. 
The  hotels  at  Skiplake  and  Henley  would  be  crammed;  and 
we could not go round, knocking up cottagers and household-
ers in the middle of the night, to know if they let apartments! 
George suggested walking back to Henley and assaulting a po-
liceman, and so getting a night’s lodging in the station-house. 
But then there was the thought, “Suppose he only hits us back 
and refuses to lock us up!”

— 153 —

We could not pass the whole night fighting policemen. Be-
sides, we did not want to overdo the thing and get six months.
We  despairingly  tried  what  seemed  in  the  darkness  to  be 
the fourth island, but met with no better success. The rain was 
coming down fast now, and evidently meant to last. We were 
wet to the skin, and cold and miserable. We began to wonder 
whether there were only four islands or more, or whether we 
were  near  the  islands  at  all,  or  whether  we  were  anywhere 
within a mile of where we ought to be, or in the wrong part of 
the river altogether; everything looked so strange and differ-
ent in the darkness. We began to understand the sufferings of 
the Babes in the Wood.

Just  when  we  had  given  up  all  hope — yes,  I  know  that  is 
always the time that things do happen in novels and tales; but 
I can’t help it. I resolved, when I began to write this book, that I 
would be strictly truthful in all things; and so I will be, even if 
I have to employ hackneyed phrases for the purpose.

It was just when we had given up all hope, and I must there-
fore say so. Just when we had given up all hope, then, I sud-
denly caught sight, a little way below us, of a strange, weird sort 
of glimmer flickering among the trees on the opposite bank. 
For an instant I thought of ghosts: it was such a shadowy, mys-
terious light. The next moment it flashed across me that it was 
our boat, and I sent up such a yell across the water that made 
the night seem to shake in its bed.

We waited breathless for a minute, and then — oh! divinest 
music  of  the  darkness! — we  heard  the  answering  bark  of 
Montmorency. We shouted back loud enough to wake the Sev-
en Sleepers — I never could understand myself why it should 
take more noise to wake seven sleepers than one — and, after 
what  seemed  an  hour,  but  what  was  really,  I  suppose,  about 
five minutes, we saw the lighted boat creeping slowly over the 
blackness,  and  heard  Harris’s  sleepy  voice  asking  where  we 
were.

There  was  an  unaccountable  strangeness  about  Harris.  It 
was something more than mere ordinary tiredness. He pulled 

— 154 —

the boat against a part of the bank from which it was quite im-
possible for us to get into it, and immediately went to sleep. It 
took us an immense amount of screaming and roaring to wake 
him up again and put some sense into him; but we succeeded 
at last, and got safely on board.

Harris had a sad expression on him, so we noticed, when we 
got into the boat. He gave you the idea of a man who had been 
through trouble. We asked him if anything had happened, and 
he said —

“Swans!”
It seemed we had moored close to a swan’s nest, and, soon 
after George and I had gone, the female swan came back, and 
kicked up a row about it. Harris had chivied her off, and she 
had gone away, and fetched up her old man. Harris said he had 
had quite a fight with these two swans; but courage and skill 
had prevailed in the end, and he had defeated them.

Half-an-hour afterwards they returned with eighteen other 
swans! It must have been a fearful battle, so far as we could 
understand Harris’s account of it. The swans had tried to drag 
him and Montmorency out of the boat and drown them; and 
he had defended himself like a hero for four hours, and had 
killed the lot, and they had all paddled away to die.

“How many swans did you say there were?” asked George.
“Thirty-two,” replied Harris, sleepily.
“You said eighteen just now,” said George.
“No, I didn’t,” grunted Harris; “I said twelve. Think I can’t 

count?”

What were the real facts about these swans we never found 
out. We questioned Harris on the subject in the morning, and 
he said, “What swans?” and seemed to think that George and 
I had been dreaming.

Oh, how delightful it was to be safe in the boat, after our 
trials and fears! We ate a hearty supper, George and I, and we 
should have had some toddy after it, if we could have found the 
whisky, but we could not. We examined Harris as to what he 
had done with it; but he did not seem to know what we meant 

— 155 —

by “whisky,” or what we were talking about at all. Montmor-
ency looked as if he knew something, but said nothing.

I slept well that night, and should have slept better if it had 
not been for Harris. I have a vague recollection of having been 
woke up at least a dozen times during the night by Harris wan-
dering about the boat with the lantern, looking for his clothes. 
He seemed to be worrying about his clothes all night.

Twice he routed up George and myself to see if we were ly-

ing on his trousers. George got quite wild the second time.

“What  the  thunder  do  you  want  your  trousers  for,  in  the 
middle of the night?” he asked indignantly. “Why don’t you lie 
down, and go to sleep?”

I found him in trouble, the next time I awoke, because he 
could not find his socks; and my last hazy remembrance is of 
being rolled over on my side, and of hearing Harris muttering 
something  about  its  being  an  extraordinary  thing  where  his 
umbrella could have got to.

CHAPTER XV.

Household duties. — Love of work. — The old river hand, what he 
does and what he tells you he has done. — Scepticism of the new 
generation.  —  Early  boating  recollections.  —  Rafting.  —  George 
does the thing in style. — The old boatman, his method. — So calm, 
so full of peace. — The beginner. — Punting. — A sad accident. — 
Pleasures of friendship. — Sailing, my first experience. — Possible 

reason why we were not drowned.

WE woke late the next morning, and, at Harris’s earnest desire, 
partook  of  a  plain  breakfast,  with  “non  dainties.”  Then  we 
cleaned  up,  and  put  everything  straight  (a  continual  labour, 
which was beginning to afford me a pretty clear insight into 
a question that had often posed me — namely, how a woman 
with the work of only one house on her hands manages to pass 
away her time), and, at about ten, set out on what we had de-
termined should be a good day’s journey.

We  agreed  that  we  would  pull  this  morning,  as  a  change 
from towing; and Harris thought the best arrangement would 
be that George and I should scull, and he steer. I did not chime 
in with this idea at all; I said I thought Harris would have been 
showing a more proper spirit if he had suggested that he and 
George should work, and let me rest a bit. It seemed to me that 
I was doing more than my fair share of the work on this trip, 
and I was beginning to feel strongly on the subject.

It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than 
I should do. It is not that I object to the work, mind you; I like 
work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours. I love 
to keep it by me: the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my 
heart.

You cannot give me too much work; to accumulate work has 
almost become a passion with me: my study is so full of it now, 
that there is hardly an inch of room for any more. I shall have 
to throw out a wing soon.

And I am careful of my work, too. Why, some of the work 
that I have by me now has been in my possession for years and 
years, and there isn’t a finger-mark on it. I take a great pride 

— 157 —

in my work; I take it down now and then and dust it. No man 
keeps his work in a better state of preservation than I do.

But, though I crave for work, I still like to be fair. I do not ask 

for more than my proper share.

But I get it without asking for it — at least, so it appears to 

me — and this worries me.

George says he does not think I need trouble myself on the 
subject.  He  thinks  it  is  only  my  over-scrupulous  nature  that 
makes me fear I am having more than my due; and that, as a 
matter of fact, I don’t have half as much as I ought. But I expect 
he only says this to comfort me.

In a boat, I have always noticed that it is the fixed idea of 
each member of the crew that he is doing everything. Harris’s 
notion was, that it was he alone who had been working, and 
that both George and I had been imposing upon him. George, 
on the other hand, ridiculed the idea of Harris’s having done 
anything more than eat and sleep, and had a cast-iron opinion 
that it was he — George himself — who had done all the labour 
worth speaking of.

He said he had never been out with such a couple of lazily 

skulks as Harris and I.
That amused Harris.
“Fancy old George talking about work!” he laughed; “why, 
about half-an-hour of it would kill him. Have you ever seen 
George work?” he added, turning to me.

I agreed with Harris that I never had — most certainly not 

since we had started on this trip.

“Well, I don’t see how you can know much about it, one way 
or the other,” George retorted on Harris; “for I’m blest if you 
haven’t been asleep half the time. Have you ever seen Harris 
fully  awake,  except  at  meal-time?”  asked  George,  addressing 
me.

Truth  compelled  me  to  support  George.  Harris  had  been 
very little good in the boat, so far as helping was concerned, 
from the beginning.

— 158 —

“Well, hang it all, I’ve done more than old J., anyhow,” re-

joined Harris.

“Well, you couldn’t very well have done less,” added George.
“I suppose J. thinks he is the passenger,” continued Harris.
And that was their gratitude to me for having brought them 
and their wretched old boat all the way up from Kingston, and 
for having superintended and managed everything for them, 
and taken care of them, and slaved for them. It is the way of 
the world.

We  settled  the  present  difficulty  by  arranging  that  Harris 
and  George  should  scull  up  past  Reading,  and  that  I  should 
tow  the  boat  on  from  there.  Pulling  a  heavy  boat  against  a 
strong  stream  has  few  attractions  for  me  now.  There  was  a 
time, long ago, when I used to clamour for the hard work: now 
I like to give the youngsters a chance.

I notice that most of the old river hands are similarly retir-
ing,  whenever  there  is  any  stiff  pulling  to  be  done. You  can 
always tell the old river hand by the way in which he stretches 
himself out upon the cushions at the bottom of the boat, and 
encourages  the  rowers  by  telling  them  anecdotes  about  the 
marvellous feats he performed last season.

“Call what you’re doing hard work!” he drawls, between his 
contented whiffs, addressing the two perspiring novices, who 
have been grinding away steadily up stream for the last hour 
and a half; “why, Jim Biffles and Jack and I, last season, pulled 
up from Marlow to Goring in one afternoon — never stopped 
once. Do you remember that, Jack?”

Jack, who has made himself a bed up in the prow of all the 
rugs and coats he can collect, and who has been lying there 
asleep for the last two hours, partially wakes up on being thus 
appealed to, and recollects all about the matter, and also re-
members  that  there  was  an  unusually  strong  stream  against 
them all the way — likewise a stiff wind.

“About thirty-four miles, I suppose, it must have been,” adds 
the first speaker, reaching down another cushion to put under 
his head.

— 159 —

“No — no;  don’t  exaggerate,  Tom,”  murmurs  Jack,  reprov-

ingly; “thirty-three at the outside.”

And Jack and Tom, quite exhausted by this conversational 
effort, drop off to sleep once more. And the two simple-mind-
ed youngsters at the sculls feel quite proud of being allowed to 
row such wonderful oarsmen as Jack and Tom, and strain away 
harder than ever.

When I was a young man, I used to listen to these tales from 
my elders, and take them in, and swallow them, and digest eve-
ry word of them, and then come up for more; but the new gen-
eration do not seem to have the simple faith of the old times. 
We — George, Harris, and myself — took a “raw’un” up with us 
once last season, and we plied him with the customary stretch-
ers about the wonderful things we had done all the way up.

We gave him all the regular ones — the time-honoured lies 
that have done duty up the river with every boating-man for 
years  past — and  added  seven  entirely  original  ones  that  we 
had invented for ourselves, including a really quite likely story, 
founded, to a certain extent, on an all but true episode, which 
had actually happened in a modified degree some years ago to 
friends of ours — a story that a mere child could have believed 
without injuring itself, much.

And that young man mocked at them all, and wanted us to 
repeat the feats then and there, and to bet us ten to one that 
we didn’t.

We got to chatting about our rowing experiences this morn-
ing, and to recounting stories of our first efforts in the art of 
oarsmanship.  My  own  earliest  boating  recollection  is  of  five 
of us contributing threepence each and taking out a curiously 
constructed craft on the Regent’s Park lake, drying ourselves 
subsequently, in the park-keeper’s lodge.

After that, having acquired a taste for the water, I did a good 
deal  of  rafting  in  various  suburban  brickfields — an  exercise 
providing more interest and excitement than might be imag-
ined, especially when you are in the middle of the pond and 

— 160 —

the proprietor of the materials of which the raft is constructed 
suddenly appears on the bank, with a big stick in his hand.

Your first sensation on seeing this gentleman is that, some-
how or other, you don’t feel equal to company and conversa-
tion, and that, if you could do so without appearing rude, you 
would rather avoid meeting him; and your object is, therefore, 
to get off on the opposite side of the pond to which he is, and 
to go home quietly and quickly, pretending not to see him. He, 
on the contrary is yearning to take you by the hand, and talk 
to you.

It appears that he knows your father, and is intimately ac-
quainted  with  yourself,  but  this  does  not  draw  you  towards 
him. He says he’ll teach you to take his boards and make a raft 
of them; but, seeing that you know how to do this pretty well 
already, the offer, though doubtless kindly meant, seems a su-
perfluous one on his part, and you are reluctant to put him to 
any trouble by accepting it.

His anxiety to meet you, however, is proof against all your 
coolness, and the energetic manner in which he dodges up and 
down the pond so as to be on the spot to greet you when you 
land is really quite flattering.

If he be of a stout and short-winded build, you can easily 
avoid his advances; but, when he is of the youthful and long-
legged type, a meeting is inevitable. The interview is, however, 
extremely  brief,  most  of  the  conversation  being  on  his  part, 
your remarks being mostly of an exclamatory and mono-syl-
labic order, and as soon as you can tear yourself away you do 
so.

I devoted some three months to rafting, and, being then as 
proficient as there was any need to be at that branch of the art, 
I determined to go in for rowing proper, and joined one of the 
Lea boating clubs.

Being out in a boat on the river Lea, especially on Saturday 
afternoons, soon makes you smart at handling a craft, and spry 
at escaping being run down by roughs or swamped by barges; 
and it also affords plenty of opportunity for acquiring the most 

— 161 —

prompt and graceful method of lying down flat at the bottom 
of the boat so as to avoid being chucked out into the river by 
passing tow-lines.

But it does not give you style. It was not till I came to the 
Thames that I got style. My style of rowing is very much ad-
mired now. People say it is so quaint.

George never went near the water until he was sixteen. Then 
he  and  eight  other  gentlemen  of  about  the  same  age  went 
down in a body to Kew one Saturday, with the idea of hiring 
a boat there, and pulling to Richmond and back; one of their 
number, a shock-headed youth, named Joskins, who had once 
or twice taken out a boat on the Serpentine, told them it was 
jolly fun, boating!

The tide was running out pretty rapidly when they reached 
the landing-stage, and there was a stiff breeze blowing across 
the  river,  but  this  did  not  trouble  them  at  all,  and  they  pro-
ceeded to select their boat.

There was an eight-oared racing outrigger drawn up on the 
stage; that was the one that took their fancy. They said they’d 
have  that  one,  please.  The  boatman  was  away,  and  only  his 
boy was in charge. The boy tried to damp their ardour for the 
outrigger,  and  showed  them  two  or  three  very  comfortable-
looking boats of the family-party build, but those would not 
do at all; the outrigger was the boat they thought they would 
look best in.

So the boy launched it, and they took off their coats and pre-
pared to take their seats. The boy suggested that George, who, 
even  in  those  days,  was  always  the  heavy  man  of  any  party, 
should be number four. George said he should be happy to be 
number four, and promptly stepped into bow’s place, and sat 
down with his back to the stern. They got him into his proper 
position at last, and then the others followed.

A  particularly  nervous  boy  was  appointed  cox,  and  the 
steering principle explained to him by Joskins. Joskins himself 
took stroke. He told the others that it was simple enough; all 
they had to do was to follow him.

— 162 —

They said they were ready, and the boy on the landing stage 

took a boat-hook and shoved him off.

What then followed George is unable to describe in detail. 
He  has  a  confused  recollection  of  having,  immediately  on 
starting, received a violent blow in the small of the back from 
the butt-end of number five’s scull, at the same time that his 
own seat seemed to disappear from under him by magic, and 
leave him sitting on the boards. He also noticed, as a curious 
circumstance, that number two was at the same instant lying 
on his back at the bottom of the boat, with his legs in the air, 
apparently in a fit.

They  passed  under  Kew  Bridge,  broadside,  at  the  rate  of 
eight miles an hour. Joskins being the only one who was row-
ing. George, on recovering his seat, tried to help him, but, on 
dipping his oar into the water, it immediately, to his intense 
surprise,  disappeared  under  the  boat,  and  nearly  took  him 
with it.

And  then “cox”  threw  both  rudder  lines  over-board,  and 

burst into tears.

How they got back George never knew, but it took them just 
forty minutes. A dense crowd watched the entertainment from 
Kew Bridge with much interest, and everybody shouted out to 
them different directions. Three times they managed to get the 
boat back through the arch, and three times they were carried 
under  it  again,  and  every  time “cox”  looked  up  and  saw  the 
bridge above him he broke out into renewed sobs.

George said he little thought that afternoon that he should 

ever come to really like boating.

Harris is more accustomed to sea rowing than to river work, 
and says that, as an exercise, he prefers it. I don’t. I remember 
taking a small boat out at Eastbourne last summer: I used to do 
a good deal of sea rowing years ago, and I thought I should be 
all right; but I found I had forgotten the art entirely. When one 
scull was deep down underneath the water, the other would be 
flourishing wildly about in the air. To get a grip of the water 
with both at the same time I had to stand up. The parade was 

— 163 —

crowded with nobility and gentry, and I had to pull past them 
in this ridiculous fashion. I landed half-way down the beach, 
and secured the services of an old boatman to take me back.

I like to watch an old boatman rowing, especially one who 
has been hired by the hour. There is something so beautifully 
calm and restful about his method. It is so free from that fret-
ful haste, that vehement striving, that is every day becoming 
more and more the bane of nineteenth-century life. He is not 
for ever straining himself to pass all the other boats. If another 
boat overtakes him and passes him it does not annoy him; as 
a matter of fact, they all do overtake him and pass him — all 
those that are going his way. This would trouble and irritate 
some  people;  the  sublime  equanimity  of  the  hired  boatman 
under the ordeal affords us a beautiful lesson against ambition 
and uppishness.

Plain practical rowing of the get-the-boat-along order is not 
a very difficult art to acquire, but it takes a good deal of prac-
tice before a man feels comfortable, when rowing past girls. It 
is the “time” that worries a youngster. “It’s jolly funny,” he says, 
as for the twentieth time within five minutes he disentangles 
his sculls from yours; “I can get on all right when I’m by my-
self!”

To see two novices try to keep time with one another is very 
amusing.  Bow  finds  it  impossible  to  keep  pace  with  stroke, 
because stroke rows in such an extraordinary fashion. Stroke 
is  intensely  indignant  at  this,  and  explains  that  what  he  has 
been endeavouring to do for the last ten minutes is to adapt his 
method to bow’s limited capacity. Bow, in turn, then becomes 
insulted, and requests stroke not to trouble his head about him 
(bow), but to devote his mind to setting a sensible stroke.

“Or, shall I take stroke?” he adds, with the evident idea that 

that would at once put the whole matter right.

They splash along for another hundred yards with still mod-
erate success, and then the whole secret of their trouble bursts 
upon stroke like a flash of inspiration.

— 164 —

“I tell you what it is: you’ve got my sculls,” he cries, turning 

to bow; “pass yours over.”

“Well,  do  you  know,  I’ve  been  wondering  how  it  was  I 
couldn’t get on with these,” answers bow, quite brightening up, 
and most willingly assisting in the exchange. “Now we shall be 
all right.”

But they are not — not even then. Stroke has to stretch his 
arms nearly out of their sockets to reach his sculls now; while 
bow’s pair, at each recovery, hit him a violent blow in the chest. 
So they change back again, and come to the conclusion that 
the  man  has  given  them  the  wrong  set  altogether;  and  over 
their mutual abuse of this man they become quite friendly and 
sympathetic.

George  said  he  had  often  longed  to  take  to  punting  for  a 
change. Punting is not as easy as it looks. As in rowing, you 
soon learn how to get along and handle the craft, but it takes 
long practice before you can do this with dignity and without 
getting the water all up your sleeve.

One young man I knew had a very sad accident happen to 
him the first time he went punting. He had been getting on 
so well that he had grown quite cheeky over the business, and 
was walking up and down the punt, working his pole with a 
careless grace that was quite fascinating to watch. Up he would 
march  to  the  head  of  the  punt,  plant  his  pole,  and  then  run 
along right to the other end, just like an old punter. Oh! it was 
grand.

And  it  would  all  have  gone  on  being  grand  if  he  had  not 
unfortunately, while looking round to enjoy the scenery, taken 
just one step more than there was any necessity for, and walked 
off the punt altogether. The pole was firmly fixed in the mud, 
and he was left clinging to it while the punt drifted away. It 
was an undignified position for him. A rude boy on the bank 
immediately yelled out to a lagging chum to “hurry up and see 
real monkey on a stick.”

I could not go to his assistance, because, as ill-luck would 
have it, we had not taken the proper precaution to bring out a 

— 165 —

spare pole with us. I could only sit and look at him. His expres-
sion as the pole slowly sank with him I shall never forget; there 
was so much thought in it.

I watched him gently let down into the water, and saw him 
scramble out, sad and wet. I could not help laughing, he looked 
such a ridiculous figure. I continued to chuckle to myself about 
it for some time, and then it was suddenly forced in upon me 
that really I had got very little to laugh at when I came to think 
of it. Here was I, alone in a punt, without a pole, drifting help-
lessly down mid-stream — possibly towards a weir.

I  began  to  feel  very  indignant  with  my  friend  for  having 
stepped overboard and gone off in that way. He might, at all 
events, have left me the pole.

I drifted on for about a quarter of a mile, and then I came 
in sight of a fishing-punt moored in mid-stream, in which sat 
two  old  fishermen.  They  saw  me  bearing  down  upon  them, 
and they called out to me to keep out of their way.

“I can’t,” I shouted back.
“But you don’t try,” they answered.
I explained the matter to them when I got nearer, and they 
caught  me  and  lent  me  a  pole.  The  weir  was  just  fifty  yards 
below. I am glad they happened to be there.

The  first  time  I  went  punting  was  in  company  with  three 
other fellows; they were going to show me how to do it. We 
could not all start together, so I said I would go down first and 
get out the punt, and then I could potter about and practice a 
bit until they came.

I could not get a punt out that afternoon, they were all en-
gaged; so I had nothing else to do but to sit down on the bank, 
watching the river, and waiting for my friends.

I had not been sitting there long before my attention became 
attracted to a man in a punt who, I noticed with some surprise, 
wore  a  jacket  and  cap  exactly  like  mine.  He  was  evidently  a 
novice at punting, and his performance was most interesting. 
You never knew what was going to happen when he put the 
pole in; he evidently did not know himself. Sometimes he shot 

— 166 —

up stream and sometimes he shot down stream, and at other 
times he simply spun round and came up the other side of the 
pole. And with every result he seemed equally surprised and 
annoyed.

The people about the river began to get quite absorbed in 
him after a while, and to make bets with one another as to what 
would be the outcome of his next push.

In  the  course  of  time  my  friends  arrived  on  the  opposite 
bank,  and  they  stopped  and  watched  him  too.  His  back  was 
towards them, and they only saw his jacket and cap. From this 
they immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was I, their 
beloved companion, who was making an exhibition of himself, 
and their delight knew no bounds. They commenced to chaff 
him unmercifully.

I did not grasp their mistake at first, and I thought, “How 
rude of them to go on like that, with a perfect stranger, too!” 
But before I could call out and reprove them, the explanation 
of the matter occurred to me, and I withdrew behind a tree.

Oh,  how  they  enjoyed  themselves,  ridiculing  that  young 
man!  For  five  good  minutes  they  stood  there,  shouting  rib-
aldry at him, deriding him, mocking him, jeering at him. They 
peppered him with stale jokes, they even made a few new ones 
and  threw  at  him.  They  hurled  at  him  all  the  private  family 
jokes belonging to our set, and which must have been perfectly 
unintelligible to him. And then, unable to stand their brutal 
jibes any longer, he turned round on them, and they saw his 
face!

I was glad to notice that they had sufficient decency left in 
them to look very foolish. They explained to him that they had 
thought he was some one they knew. They said they hoped he 
would not deem them capable of so insulting any one except a 
personal friend of their own.

Of course their having mistaken him for a friend excused 
it.  I  remember  Harris  telling  me  once  of  a  bathing  experi-
ence he had at Boulogne. He was swimming about there near 
the beach, when he felt himself suddenly seized by the neck 

— 167 —

from behind, and forcibly plunged under water. He struggled 
violently,  but  whoever  had  got  hold  of  him  seemed  to  be  a 
perfect Hercules in strength, and all his efforts to escape were 
unavailing. He had given up kicking, and was trying to turn his 
thoughts upon solemn things, when his captor released him.

He  regained  his  feet,  and  looked  round  for  his  would-be 
murderer.  The  assassin  was  standing  close  by  him,  laughing 
heartily,  but  the  moment  he  caught  sight  of  Harris’s  face,  as 
it emerged from the water, he started back and seemed quite 
concerned.

“I really beg your pardon,” he stammered confusedly, “but I 

took you for a friend of mine!”

Harris thought it was lucky for him the man had not mis-
taken  him  for  a  relation,  or  he  would  probably  have  been 
drowned outright.

Sailing is a thing that wants knowledge and practice too — 
though, as a boy, I did not think so. I had an idea it came natu-
ral to a body, like rounders and touch. I knew another boy who 
held this view likewise, and so, one windy day, we thought we 
would try the sport. We were stopping down at Yarmouth, and 
we decided we would go for a trip up the Yare. We hired a sail-
ing boat at the yard by the bridge, and started off. “It’s rather a 
rough day,” said the man to us, as we put off: “better take in a 
reef and luff sharp when you get round the bend.”

We said we would make a point of it, and left him with a 
cheery  “Good-morning,”  wondering  to  ourselves  how  you 
“luffed,” and where we were to get a “reef ” from, and what we 
were to do with it when we had got it.

We rowed until we were out of sight of the town, and then, 
with a wide stretch of water in front of us, and the wind blow-
ing a perfect hurricane across it, we felt that the time had come 
to commence operations.

Hector — I think that was his name — went on pulling while 
I unrolled the sail. It seemed a complicated job, but I accom-
plished it at length, and then came the question, which was the 
top end?

— 168 —

By  a  sort  of  natural  instinct,  we,  of  course,  eventually  de-
cided  that  the  bottom  was  the  top,  and  set  to  work  to  fix  it 
upside-down. But it was a long time before we could get it up, 
either that way or any other way. The impression on the mind 
of the sail seemed to be that we were playing at funerals, and 
that I was the corpse and itself was the winding-sheet.

When it found that this was not the idea, it hit me over the 

head with the boom, and refused to do anything.

“Wet it,” said Hector; “drop it over and get it wet.”
He said people in ships always wetted the sails before they 
put them up. So I wetted it; but that only made matters worse 
than  they  were  before.  A  dry  sail  clinging  to  your  legs  and 
wrapping itself round your head is not pleasant, but, when the 
sail is sopping wet, it becomes quite vexing.

We did get the thing up at last, the two of us together. We 
fixed it, not exactly upside down — more sideways like — and 
we tied it up to the mast with the painter, which we cut off for 
the purpose.

That the boat did not upset I simply state as a fact. Why it 
did  not  upset  I  am  unable  to  offer  any  reason.  I  have  often 
thought about the matter since, but I have never succeeded in 
arriving at any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon.

Possibly  the  result  may  have  been  brought  about  by  the 
natural  obstinacy  of  all  things  in  this  world.  The  boat  may 
possibly have come to the conclusion, judging from a cursory 
view of our behaviour, that we had come out for a morning’s 
suicide, and had thereupon determined to disappoint us. That 
is the only suggestion I can offer.

By clinging like grim death to the gunwale, we just managed 
to  keep  inside  the  boat,  but  it  was  exhausting  work.  Hector 
said that pirates and other seafaring people generally lashed 
the rudder to something or other, and hauled in the main top-
jib, during severe squalls, and thought we ought to try to do 
something of the kind; but I was for letting her have her head 
to the wind.

As my advice was by far the easiest to follow, we ended by 

— 169 —

adopting  it,  and  contrived  to  embrace  the  gunwale  and  give 
her her head.

The  boat  travelled  up  stream  for  about  a  mile  at  a  pace  I 
have never sailed at since, and don’t want to again. Then, at a 
bend, she heeled over till half her sail was under water. Then 
she righted herself by a miracle and flew for a long low bank 
of soft mud.

That mud-bank saved us. The boat ploughed its way into the 
middle of it and then stuck. Finding that we were once more 
able to move according to our ideas, instead of being pitched 
and thrown about like peas in a bladder, we crept forward, and 
cut down the sail.

We  had  had  enough  sailing.  We  did  not  want  to  overdo 
the thing and get a surfeit of it. We had had a sail — a good 
all-round exciting, interesting sail — and now we thought we 
would have a row, just for a change like.

We took the sculls and tried to push the boat off the mud, 
and, in doing so, we broke one of the sculls. After that we pro-
ceeded with great caution, but they were a wretched old pair, 
and the second one cracked almost easier than the first, and 
left us helpless.

The mud stretched out for about a hundred yards in front of 
us, and behind us was the water. The only thing to be done was 
to sit and wait until someone came by.

It was not the sort of day to attract people out on the river, 
and it was three hours before a soul came in sight. It was an 
old  fisherman  who,  with  immense  difficulty,  at  last  rescued 
us, and we were towed back in an ignominious fashion to the 
boat-yard.

What between tipping the man who had brought us home, 
and paying for the broken sculls, and for having been out four 
hours  and  a  half,  it  cost  us  a  pretty  considerable  number  of 
weeks’ pocket-money, that sail. But we learned experience, and 
they say that is always cheap at any price.

CHAPTER XVI.

Reading. — We are towed by steam launch. — Irritating behaviour 
of  small  boats. — How  they  get  in  the  way  of  steam  launches. — 
George and Harris again shirk their work. — Rather a hackneyed 

story. — Streatley and Goring.

WE came in sight of Reading about eleven. The river is dirty 
and dismal here. One does not linger in the neighbourhood 
of Reading. The town itself is a famous old place, dating from 
the dim days of King Ethelred, when the Danes anchored their 
warships in the Kennet, and started from Reading to ravage all 
the land of Wessex; and here Ethelred and his brother Alfred 
fought and defeated them, Ethelred doing the praying and Al-
fred the fighting.

In  later  years,  Reading  seems  to  have  been  regarded  as  a 
handy  place  to  run  down  to,  when  matters  were  becoming 
unpleasant  in  London.  Parliament  generally  rushed  off  to 
Reading whenever there was a plague on at Westminster; and, 
in 1625, the Law followed suit, and all the courts were held at 
Reading. It must have been worth while having a mere ordi-
nary plague now and then in London to get rid of both the 
lawyers and the Parliament.

During the Parliamentary struggle, Reading was besieged by 
the Earl of Essex, and, a quarter of a century later, the Prince of 
Orange routed King James’s troops there.

Henry  I.  lies  buried  at  Reading,  in  the  Benedictine  abbey 
founded  by  him  there,  the  ruins  of  which  may  still  be  seen; 
and, in this same abbey, great John of Gaunt was married to 
the Lady Blanche.

At Reading lock we came up with a steam launch, belong-
ing to some friends of mine, and they towed us up to within 
about  a  mile  of  Streatley.  It  is  very  delightful  being  towed 
up  by  a  launch.  I  prefer  it  myself  to  rowing.  The  run  would 
have been more delightful still, if it had not been for a lot of 
wretched small boats that were continually getting in the way 
of our launch, and, to avoid running down which, we had to 

— 171 —

be continually easing and stopping. It is really most annoying, 
the manner in which these rowing boats get in the way of one’s 
launch up the river; something ought to done to stop it.

And they are so confoundedly impertinent, too, over it. You 
can whistle till you nearly burst your boiler before they will 
trouble themselves to hurry. I would have one or two of them 
run down now and then, if I had my way, just to teach them 
all a lesson.

The river becomes very lovely from a little above Reading. 
The railway rather spoils it near Tilehurst, but from Mapledur-
ham up to Streatley it is glorious. A little above Mapledurham 
lock you pass Hardwick House, where Charles I. played bowls. 
The  neighbourhood  of  Pangbourne,  where  the  quaint  little 
Swan Inn stands, must be as familiar to the habitués of the Art 
Exhibitions as it is to its own inhabitants.

My friends’ launch cast us loose just below the grotto, and 
then Harris wanted to make out that it was my turn to pull. 
This seemed to me most unreasonable. It had been arranged 
in the morning that I should bring the boat up to three miles 
above Reading. Well, here we were, ten miles above Reading! 
Surely it was now their turn again.

I  could  not  get  either  George  or  Harris  to  see  the  matter 
in its proper light, however; so, to save argument, I took the 
sculls. I had not been pulling for more than a minute or so, 
when  George  noticed  something  black  floating  on  the  wa-
ter, and we drew up to it. George leant over, as we neared it, 
and laid hold of it. And then he drew back with a cry, and a 
blanched face.

It was the dead body of a woman. It lay very lightly on the 
water, and the face was sweet and calm. It was not a beautiful 
face; it was too prematurely aged-looking, too thin and drawn, 
to be that; but it was a gentle, lovable face, in spite of its stamp 
of pinch and poverty, and upon it was that look of restful peace 
that comes to the faces of the sick sometimes when at last the 
pain has left them.

Fortunately for us — we having no desire to be kept hanging 

— 172 —

about coroners’ courts — some men on the bank had seen the 
body too, and now took charge of it from us.

We found out the woman’s story afterwards. Of course it was 
the old, old vulgar tragedy. She had loved and been deceived — 
or  had  deceived  herself. Anyhow,  she  had  sinned — some  of 
us  do  now  and  then — and  her  family  and  friends,  naturally 
shocked and indignant, had closed their doors against her.

Left to fight the world alone, with the millstone of her shame 
around  her  neck,  she  had  sunk  ever  lower  and  lower.  For  a 
while  she  had  kept  both  herself  and  the  child  on  the  twelve 
shillings  a  week  that  twelve  hours’  drudgery  a  day  procured 
her, paying six shillings out of it for the child, and keeping her 
own body and soul together on the remainder.

Six shillings a week does not keep body and soul together 
very  unitedly.  They  want  to  get  away  from  each  other  when 
there is only such a very slight bond as that between them; and 
one day, I suppose, the pain and the dull monotony of it all 
had stood before her eyes plainer than usual, and the mock-
ing spectre had frightened her. She had made one last appeal 
to friends, but, against the chill wall of their respectability, the 
voice  of  the  erring  outcast  fell  unheeded;  and  then  she  had 
gone to see her child — had held it in her arms and kissed it, in 
a weary, dull sort of way, and without betraying any particular 
emotion of any kind, and had left it, after putting into its hand 
a penny box of chocolate she had bought it, and afterwards, 
with her last few shillings, had taken a ticket and come down 
to Goring.

It seemed that the bitterest thoughts of her life must have 
centred  about  the  wooded  reaches  and  the  bright  green 
meadows around Goring; but women strangely hug the knife 
that stabs them, and, perhaps, amidst the gall, there may have 
mingled also sunny memories of sweetest hours, spent upon 
those shadowed deeps over which the great trees bend their 
branches down so low.

She had wandered about the woods by the river’s brink all 
day, and then, when evening fell and the grey twilight spread 

— 173 —

its dusky robe upon the waters, she stretched her arms out to 
the silent river that had known her sorrow and her joy. And the 
old river had taken her into its gentle arms, and had laid her 
weary head upon its bosom, and had hushed away the pain.

Thus had she sinned in all things — sinned in living and in 
dying. God help her! and all other sinners, if any more there 
be.

Goring on the left bank and Streatley on the right are both 
or either charming places to stay at for a few days. The reaches 
down to Pangbourne woo one for a sunny sail or for a moon-
light row, and the country round about is full of beauty. We 
had intended to push on to Wallingford that day, but the sweet 
smiling face of the river here lured us to linger for a while; and 
so we left our boat at the bridge, and went up into Streatley, and 
lunched at the “Bull,” much to Montmorency’s satisfaction.

They say that the hills on each side of the stream here once 
joined and formed a barrier across what is now the Thames, 
and that then the river ended there above Goring in one vast 
lake. I am not in a position either to contradict or affirm this 
statement. I simply offer it.

It is an ancient place, Streatley, dating back, like most river-
side towns and villages, to British and Saxon times. Goring is 
not nearly so pretty a little spot to stop at as Streatley, if you 
have your choice; but it is passing fair enough in its way, and is 
nearer the railway in case you want to slip off without paying 
your hotel bill.

CHAPTER XVII.

Washing day. — Fish and fishers. — On the art of angling. — A con-

scientious fly-fisher. — A fishy story.

WE stayed two days at Streatley, and got our clothes washed. 
We  had  tried  washing  them  ourselves,  in  the  river,  under 
George’s superintendence, and it had been a failure. Indeed, it 
had been more than a failure, because we were worse off after 
we had washed our clothes than we were before. Before we had 
washed them, they had been very, very dirty, it is true; but they 
were just wearable. After we had washed them — well, the river 
between Reading and Henley was much cleaner, after we had 
washed our clothes in it, than it was before. All the dirt con-
tained in the river between Reading and Henley, we collected, 
during that wash, and worked it into our clothes.

The washerwoman at Streatley said she felt she owed it to 
herself to charge us just three times the usual prices for that 
wash. She said it had not been like washing, it had been more 
in the nature of excavating.

We paid the bill without a murmur.
The neighbourhood of Streatley and Goring is a great fish-
ing centre. There is some excellent fishing to be had here. The 
river abounds in pike, roach, dace, gudgeon, and eels, just here; 
and you can sit and fish for them all day.

Some  people  do.  They  never  catch  them.  I  never  knew 
anybody catch anything, up the Thames, except minnows and 
dead cats, but that has nothing to do, of course, with fishing! 
The local fisherman’s guide doesn’t say a word about catching 
anything. All it says is the place is “a good station for fishing;” 
and, from what I have seen of the district, I am quite prepared 
to bear out this statement.

There is no spot in the world where you can get more fish-
ing, or where you can fish for a longer period. Some fishermen 
come here and fish for a day, and others stop and fish for a 
month. You can hang on and fish for a year, if you want to: it 
will be all the same.

— 175 —

The Angler’s Guide to the Thames says that “jack and perch 
are also to be had about here,” but there the Angler’s Guide is 
wrong. Jack and perch may be about there. Indeed, I know for 
a fact that they are. You can see them there in shoals, when you 
are out for a walk along the banks: they come and stand half 
out of the water with their mouths open for biscuits. And, if 
you go for a bathe, they crowd round, and get in your way, and 
irritate you. But they are not to be “had” by a bit of worm on 
the end of a hook, nor anything like it — not they!

I am not a good fisherman myself. I devoted a considerable 
amount of attention to the subject at one time, and was getting 
on, as I thought, fairly well; but the old hands told me that I 
should never be any real good at it, and advised me to give it 
up. They said that I was an extremely neat thrower, and that 
I seemed to have plenty of gumption for the thing, and quite 
enough  constitutional  laziness.  But  they  were  sure  I  should 
never make anything of a fisherman. I had not got sufficient 
imagination.

They said that as a poet, or a shilling shocker, or a reporter, 
or anything of that kind, I might be satisfactory, but that, to 
gain any position as a Thames angler, would require more play 
of fancy, more power of invention than I appeared to possess.
Some  people  are  under  the  impression  that  all  that  is  re-
quired to make a good fisherman is the ability to tell lies easily 
and without blushing; but this is a mistake. Mere bald fabrica-
tion  is  useless;  the  veriest  tyro  can  manage  that.  It  is  in  the 
circumstantial detail, the embellishing touches of probability, 
the general air of scrupulous — almost of pedantic — veracity, 
that the experienced angler is seen.

Anybody can come in and say, “Oh, I caught fifteen dozen 
perch yesterday evening;” or “Last Monday I landed a gudg-
eon, weighing eighteen pounds, and measuring three feet from 
the tip to the tail.”

There is no art, no skill, required for that sort of thing. It 

shows pluck, but that is all.

— 176 —

No; your accomplished angler would scorn to tell a lie, that 

way. His method is a study in itself.

He comes in quietly with his hat on, appropriates the most 
comfortable chair, lights his pipe, and commences to puff in 
silence. He lets the youngsters brag away for a while, and then, 
during a momentary lull, he removes the pipe from his mouth, 
and remarks, as he knocks the ashes out against the bars:

“Well, I had a haul on Tuesday evening that it’s not much 

good my telling anybody about.”

“Oh! why’s that?” they ask.
“Because I don’t expect anybody would believe me if I did,” 
replies the old fellow calmly, and without even a tinge of bitter-
ness in his tone, as he refills his pipe, and requests the landlord 
to bring him three of Scotch, cold.

There is a pause after this, nobody feeling sufficiently sure 
of himself to contradict the old gentleman. So he has to go on 
by himself without any encouragement.

“No,” he continues thoughtfully; “I shouldn’t believe it my-
self if anybody told it to me, but it’s a fact, for all that. I had 
been  sitting  there  all  the  afternoon  and  had  caught  literally 
nothing — except a few dozen dace and a score of jack; and I 
was just about giving it up as a bad job when I suddenly felt a 
rather smart pull at the line. I thought it was another little one, 
and I went to jerk it up. Hang me, if I could move the rod! It 
took me half-an-hour — half-an-hour, sir! — to land that fish; 
and  every  moment  I  thought  the  line  was  going  to  snap!  I 
reached him at last, and what do you think it was? A sturgeon! 
a forty pound sturgeon! taken on a line, sir! Yes, you may well 
look  surprised — I’ll  have  another  three  of  Scotch,  landlord, 
please.”

And then he goes on to tell of the astonishment of every-
body who saw it; and what his wife said, when he got home, 
and of what Joe Buggles thought about it.

I asked the landlord of an inn up the river once, if it did not 
injure him, sometimes, listening to the tales that the fishermen 
about there told him; and he said:

— 177 —

“Oh, no; not now, sir. It did used to knock me over a bit at 
first, but, lor love you! me and the missus we listens to ’em all 
day  now.  It’s  what  you’re  used  to,  you  know.  It’s  what  you’re 
used to.”

I knew a young man once, he was a most conscientious fel-
low, and, when he took to fly-fishing, he determined never to 
exaggerate his hauls by more than twenty-five per cent.

“When  I  have  caught  forty  fish,”  said  he, “then  I  will  tell 
people that I have caught fifty, and so on. But I will not lie any 
more than that, because it is sinful to lie.”

But the twenty-five per cent. plan did not work well at all. 
He never was able to use it. The greatest number of fish he ever 
caught in one day was three, and you can’t add twenty-five per 
cent. to three — at least, not in fish.

So he increased his percentage to thirty-three-and-a-third; 
but  that,  again,  was  awkward,  when  he  had  only  caught  one 
or two; so, to simplify matters, he made up his mind to just 
double the quantity.

He stuck to this arrangement for a couple of months, and 
then he grew dissatisfied with it. Nobody believed him when 
he told them that he only doubled, and he, therefore, gained 
no credit that way whatever, while his moderation put him at 
a disadvantage among the other anglers. When he had really 
caught three small fish, and said he had caught six, it used to 
make him quite jealous to hear a man, whom he knew for a 
fact  had  only  caught  one,  going  about  telling  people  he  had 
landed two dozen.

So, eventually, he made one final arrangement with himself, 
which  he  has  religiously  held  to  ever  since,  and  that  was  to 
count each fish that he caught as ten, and to assume ten to be-
gin with. For example, if he did not catch any fish at all, then he 
said he had caught ten fish — you could never catch less than 
ten fish by his system; that was the foundation of it. Then, if 
by any chance he really did catch one fish, he called it twenty, 
while two fish would count thirty, three forty, and so on.

It  is  a  simple  and  easily  worked  plan,  and  there  has  been 

— 178 —

some talk lately of its being made use of by the angling frater-
nity in general. Indeed, the Committee of the Thames Angler’s 
Association did recommend its adoption about two years ago, 
but  some  of  the  older  members  opposed  it.  They  said  they 
would consider the idea if the number were doubled, and each 
fish counted as twenty.

If ever you have an evening to spare, up the river, I should 
advise you to drop into one of the little village inns, and take 
a seat in the tap-room. You will be nearly sure to meet one or 
two old rod-men, sipping their toddy there, and they will tell 
you enough fishy stories, in half an hour, to give you indiges-
tion for a month.

George and I — I don’t know what had become of Harris; he 
had gone out and had a shave, early in the afternoon, and had 
then come back and spent full forty minutes in pipeclaying his 
shoes,  we  had  not  seen  him  since — George  and  I,  therefore, 
and the dog, left to ourselves, went for a walk to Wallingford 
on the second evening, and, coming home, we called in at a lit-
tle river-side inn, for a rest, and other things.

We went into the parlour and sat down. There was an old 
fellow there, smoking a long clay pipe, and we naturally began 
chatting.

He told us that it had been a fine day to-day, and we told him 
that it had been a fine day yesterday, and then we all told each 
other that we thought it would be a fine day to-morrow; and 
George said the crops seemed to be coming up nicely.

After  that  it  came  out,  somehow  or  other,  that  we  were 
strangers in the neighbourhood, and that we were going away 
the next morning.

Then a pause ensued in the conversation, during which our 
eyes  wandered  round  the  room.  They  finally  rested  upon  a 
dusty  old  glass-case,  fixed  very  high  up  above  the  chimney-
piece,  and  containing  a  trout.  It  rather  fascinated  me,  that 
trout;  it  was  such  a  monstrous  fish.  In  fact,  at  first  glance,  I 
thought it was a cod.

— 179 —

“Ah!” said the old gentleman, following the direction of my 

gaze, “fine fellow that, ain’t he?”

“Quite uncommon,” I murmured; and George asked the old 

man how much he thought it weighed.

“Eighteen  pounds  six  ounces,”  said  our  friend,  rising  and 
taking down his coat. “Yes,” he continued, “it wur sixteen year 
ago, come the third o’ next month, that I landed him. I caught 
him just below the bridge with a minnow. They told me he wur 
in the river, and I said I’d have him, and so I did. You don’t see 
many fish that size about here now, I’m thinking. Good-night, 
gentlemen, good-night.”

And out he went, and left us alone.
We could not take our eyes off the fish after that. It really 
was a remarkably fine fish. We were still looking at it, when 
the local carrier, who had just stopped at the inn, came to the 
door of the room with a pot of beer in his hand, and he also 
looked at the fish.

“Good-sized  trout,  that,”  said  George,  turning  round  to 

him.

hood.

“Ah! you may well say that, sir,” replied the man; and then, 
after a pull at his beer, he added, “Maybe you wasn’t here, sir, 
when that fish was caught?”

“No,”  we  told  him.  We  were  strangers  in  the  neighbour-

“Ah!” said the carrier, “then, of course, how should you? It 

was nearly five years ago that I caught that trout.”

“Oh! was it you who caught it, then?” said I.
“Yes,  sir,”  replied  the  genial  old  fellow. “I  caught  him  just 
below  the  lock — leastways,  what  was  the  lock  then — one 
Friday afternoon; and the remarkable thing about it is that I 
caught him with a fly. I’d gone out pike fishing, bless you, never 
thinking of a trout, and when I saw that whopper on the end 
of my line, blest if it didn’t quite take me aback. Well, you see, 
he weighed twenty-six pound. Good-night, gentlemen, good-
night.”

Five minutes afterwards, a third man came in, and described 

— 180 —

how he had caught it early one morning, with bleak; and then 
he left, and a stolid, solemn-looking, middle-aged individual 
came in, and sat down over by the window.

None of us spoke for a while; but, at length, George turned 

to the new comer, and said:

“I beg your pardon, I hope you will forgive the liberty that 
we — perfect strangers in the neighbourhood — are taking, but 
my friend here and myself would be so much obliged if you 
would tell us how you caught that trout up there.”

“Why, who told you I caught that trout!” was the surprised 

query.

We said that nobody had told us so, but somehow or other 

we felt instinctively that it was he who had done it.

“Well, it’s a most remarkable thing — most remarkable,” an-
swered the stolid stranger, laughing; “because, as a matter of 
fact, you are quite right. I did catch it. But fancy your guessing 
it like that. Dear me, it’s really a most remarkable thing.”

And then he went on, and told us how it had taken him half 
an hour to land it, and how it had broken his rod. He said he 
had  weighed  it  carefully  when  he  reached  home,  and  it  had 
turned the scale at thirty-four pounds.

He  went  in  his  turn,  and  when  he  was  gone,  the  landlord 
came in to us. We told him the various histories we had heard 
about  his  trout,  and  he  was  immensely  amused,  and  we  all 
laughed very heartily.

“Fancy  Jim  Bates  and  Joe  Muggles  and  Mr.  Jones  and  old 
Billy Maunders all telling you that they had caught it. Ha! ha! 
ha!  Well,  that  is  good,”  said  the  honest  old  fellow,  laughing 
heartily. “Yes, they are the sort to give it me, to put up in my 
parlour, if they had caught it, they are! Ha! ha! ha!”

And then he told us the real history of the fish. It seemed 
that he had caught it himself, years ago, when he was quite a 
lad; not by any art or skill, but by that unaccountable luck that 
appears to always wait upon a boy when he plays the wag from 
school, and goes out fishing on a sunny afternoon, with a bit of 
string tied on to the end of a tree.

— 181 —

He said that bringing home that trout had saved him from 
a whacking, and that even his school-master had said it was 
worth the rule-of-three and practice put together.

He was called out of the room at this point, and George and 

I again turned our gaze upon the fish.

It really was a most astonishing trout. The more we looked 

at it, the more we marvelled at it.

It excited George so much that he climbed up on the back of 

a chair to get a better view of it.

And then the chair slipped, and George clutched wildly at 
the trout-case to save himself, and down it came with a crash, 
George and the chair on top of it.

“You haven’t injured the fish, have you?” I cried in alarm, 

rushing up.

about.

“I  hope  not,”  said  George,  rising  cautiously  and  looking 

But he had. That trout lay shattered into a thousand frag-
ments — I say a thousand, but they may have only been nine 
hundred. I did not count them.

We thought it strange and unaccountable that a stuffed trout 

should break up into little pieces like that.

And so it would have been strange and unaccountable, if it 

had been a stuffed trout, but it was not.

That trout was plaster-of-Paris.

CHAPTER XVIII.

Locks. — George and I are photographed. — Wallingford. — Dorches-
ter. — Abingdon. — A family man. — A good spot for drowning. —

A difficult bit of water. — Demoralizing effect of river air.

WE left Streatley early the next morning, and pulled up to Cul-
ham, and slept under the canvas, in the backwater there.

The river is not extraordinarily interesting between Streat-
ley and Wallingford. From Cleve you get a stretch of six and a 
half miles without a lock. I believe this is the longest uninter-
rupted  stretch  anywhere  above  Teddington,  and  the  Oxford 
Club make use of it for their trial eights.

But  however  satisfactory  this  absence  of  locks  may  be  to 
rowing-men, it is to be regretted by the mere pleasure-seeker.
For  myself,  I  am  fond  of  locks.  They  pleasantly  break  the 
monotony of the pull. I like sitting in the boat and slowly rising 
out of the cool depths up into new reaches and fresh views; or 
sinking down, as it were, out of the world, and then waiting, 
while the gloomy gates creak, and the narrow strip of day-light 
between them widens till the fair smiling river lies full before 
you, and you push your little boat out from its brief prison on 
to the welcoming waters once again.

They  are  picturesque  little  spots,  these  locks.  The  stout 
old  lock-keeper,  or  his  cheerful-looking  wife,  or  bright-eyed 
daughter, are pleasant folk to have a passing chat with.* You 
meet  other  boats  there,  and  river  gossip  is  exchanged.  The 
Thames  would  not  be  the  fairyland  it  is  without  its  flower-
decked locks.

Talking of locks reminds me of an accident George and I 

very nearly had one summer’s morning at Hampton Court.

It was a glorious day, and the lock was crowded; and, as is a 
* Or rather were. The Conservancy of late seems to have constituted 
itself into a society for the employment of idiots. A good many of the 
new lock-keepers, especially in the more crowded portions of the river, 
are excitable, nervous old men, quite unfitted for their post.

— 183 —

common practice up the river, a speculative photographer was 
taking a picture of us all as we lay upon the rising waters.

I did not catch what was going on at first, and was, therefore, 
extremely surprised at noticing George hurriedly smooth out 
his trousers, ruffle up his hair, and stick his cap on in a rakish 
manner at the back of his head, and then, assuming an expres-
sion of mingled affability and sadness, sit down in a graceful 
attitude, and try to hide his feet.

My first idea was that he had suddenly caught sight of some 
girl he knew, and I looked about to see who it was. Everybody 
in  the  lock  seemed  to  have  been  suddenly  struck  wooden. 
They were all standing or sitting about in the most quaint and 
curious attitudes I have ever seen off a Japanese fan. All the 
girls were smiling. Oh, they did look so sweet! And all the fel-
lows were frowning, and looking stern and noble.

And then, at last, the truth flashed across me, and I won-
dered  if  I  should  be  in  time.  Ours  was  the  first  boat,  and  it 
would be unkind of me to spoil the man’s picture, I thought.

So I faced round quickly, and took up a position in the prow, 
where I leant with careless grace upon the hitcher, in an atti-
tude suggestive of agility and strength. I arranged my hair with 
a curl over the forehead, and threw an air of tender wistfulness 
into my expression, mingled with a touch of cynicism, which 
I am told suits me.

As we stood, waiting for the eventful moment, I heard some-

one behind call out:

“Hi! look at your nose.”
I  could  not  turn  round  to  see  what  was  the  matter,  and 
whose nose it was that was to be looked at. I stole a side-glance 
at George’s nose! It was all right — at all events, there was noth-
ing wrong with it that could be altered. I squinted down at my 
own, and that seemed all that could be expected also.

“Look at your nose, you stupid ass!” came the same voice 

again, louder.

And then another voice cried:

— 184 —

“Push  your  nose  out,  can’t  you,  you — you  two  with  the 

dog!”

Neither George nor I dared to turn round. The man’s hand 
was on the cap, and the picture might be taken any moment. 
Was it us they were calling to? What was the matter with our 
noses? Why were they to be pushed out!

But  now  the  whole  lock  started  yelling,  and  a  stentorian 

voice from the back shouted:

“Look at your boat, sir; you in the red and black caps. It’s 
your two corpses that will get taken in that photo, if you ain’t 
quick.”

We looked then, and saw that the nose of our boat had got 
fixed  under  the  woodwork  of  the  lock,  while  the  in-coming 
water  was  rising  all  around  it,  and  tilting  it  up.  In  another 
moment we should be over. Quick as thought, we each seized 
an oar, and a vigorous blow against the side of the lock with 
the butt-ends released the boat, and sent us sprawling on our 
backs.

We did not come out well in that photograph, George and I. 
Of course, as was to be expected, our luck ordained it, that the 
man should set his wretched machine in motion at the precise 
moment that we were both lying on our backs with a wild ex-
pression of “Where am I? and what is it?” on our faces, and our 
four feet waving madly in the air.

Our feet were undoubtedly the leading article in that pho-
tograph. Indeed, very little else was to be seen. They filled up 
the  foreground  entirely.  Behind  them,  you  caught  glimpses 
of  the  other  boats,  and  bits  of  the  surrounding  scenery;  but 
everything  and  everybody  else  in  the  lock  looked  so  utterly 
insignificant  and  paltry  compared  with  our  feet,  that  all  the 
other people felt quite ashamed of themselves, and refused to 
subscribe to the picture.

The owner of one steam launch, who had bespoke six copies, 
rescinded the order on seeing the negative. He said he would 
take them if anybody could show him his launch, but nobody 
could. It was somewhere behind George’s right foot.

— 185 —

There was a good deal of unpleasantness over the business. 
The  photographer  thought  we  ought  to  take  a  dozen  copies 
each, seeing that the photo was about nine-tenths us, but we 
declined. We said we had no objection to being photo’d full-
length, but we preferred being taken the right way up.

Wallingford, six miles above Streatley, is a very ancient town, 
and has been an active centre for the making of English his-
tory. It was a rude, mud-built town in the time of the Britons, 
who squatted there, until the Roman legions evicted them; and 
replaced  their  clay-baked  walls  by  mighty  fortifications,  the 
trace of which Time has not yet succeeded in sweeping away, 
so well those old-world masons knew how to build.

But Time, though he halted at Roman walls, soon crumbled 
Romans to dust; and on the ground, in later years, fought sav-
age Saxons and huge Danes, until the Normans came.

It was a walled and fortified town up to the time of the Par-
liamentary War, when it suffered a long and bitter siege from 
Fairfax. It fell at last, and then the walls were razed.

From Wallingford up to Dorchester the neighbourhood of 
the river grows more hilly, varied, and picturesque. Dorchester 
stands half a mile from the river. It can be reached by paddling 
up the Thame, if you have a small boat; but the best way is to 
leave the river at Day’s Lock, and take a walk across the fields. 
Dorchester is a delightfully peaceful old place, nestling in still-
ness and silence and drowsiness.

Dorchester,  like Wallingford,  was  a  city  in  ancient  British 
times; it was then called Caer Doren, “the city on the water.” In 
more recent times the Romans formed a great camp here, the 
fortifications surrounding which now seem like low, even hills. 
In Saxon days it was the capital of Wessex. It is very old, and it 
was very strong and great once. Now it sits aside from the stir-
ring world, and nods and dreams.

Round Clifton Hampden, itself a wonderfully pretty village, 
old-fashioned,  peaceful,  and  dainty  with  flowers,  the  river 
scenery is rich and beautiful. If you stay the night on land at 
Clifton, you cannot do better than put up at the “Barley Mow.” 

— 186 —

It is, without exception, I should say, the quaintest, most old-
world inn up the river. It stands on the right of the bridge, quite 
away from the village. Its low-pitched gables and thatched roof 
and  latticed  windows  give  it  quite  a  story-book  appearance, 
while inside it is even still more once-upon-a-timeyfied.

It would not be a good place for the heroine of a modern 
novel  to  stay  at.  The  heroine  of  a  modern  novel  is  always 
“divinely tall,” and she is ever “drawing herself up to her full 
height.” At the “Barley Mow” she would bump her head against 
the ceiling each time she did this.

It would also be a bad house for a drunken man to put up at. 
There are too many surprises in the way of unexpected steps 
down into this room and up into that; and as for getting up-
stairs to his bedroom, or ever finding his bed when he got up, 
either operation would be an utter impossibility to him.

We were up early the next morning, as we wanted to be in 
Oxford by the afternoon. It is surprising how early one can get 
up, when camping out. One does not yearn for “just another 
five minutes” nearly so much, lying wrapped up in a rug on the 
boards of a boat, with a Gladstone bag for a pillow, as one does 
in a featherbed. We had finished breakfast, and were through 
Clifton Lock by half-past eight.

From Clifton to Culham the river banks are flat, monoto-
nous,  and  uninteresting,  but,  after  you  get  through  Culhalm 
Lock — the coldest and deepest lock on the river — the land-
scape improves.

At Abingdon, the river passes by the streets. Abingdon is a 
typical country town of the smaller order — quiet, eminently 
respectable, clean, and desperately dull. It prides itself on being 
old, but whether it can compare in this respect with Walling-
ford  and  Dorchester  seems  doubtful. A  famous  abbey  stood 
here once, and within what is left of its sanctified walls they 
brew bitter ale nowadays.

In St. Nicholas Church, at Abingdon, there is a monument 
to John Blackwall and his wife Jane, who both, after leading a 
happy married life, died on the very same day, August 21, 1625; 

— 187 —

and in St. Helen’s Church, it is recorded that W. Lee, who died 
in 1637, “had in his lifetime issue from his loins two hundred 
lacking but three.” If you work this out you will find that Mr. W. 
Lee’s family numbered one hundred and ninety-seven. Mr. W. 
Lee — five times Mayor of Abingdon — was, no doubt, a ben-
efactor to his generation, but I hope there are not many of his 
kind about in this overcrowded nineteenth century.

From Abingdon to Nuneham Courteney is a lovely stretch. 
Nuneham Park is well worth a visit. It can be viewed on Tues-
days and Thursdays. The house contains a fine collection of 
pictures and curiosities, and the grounds are very beautiful.

The pool under Sandford lasher, just behind the lock, is a 
very good place to drown yourself in. The undercurrent is ter-
ribly strong, and if you once get down into it you are all right. 
An obelisk marks the spot where two men have already been 
drowned, while bathing there; and the steps of the obelisk are 
generally used as a diving-board by young men now who wish 
to see if the place really is dangerous.

Iffley  Lock  and  Mill,  a  mile  before  you  reach  Oxford,  is  a 
favourite subject with the river-loving brethren of the brush. 
The real article, however, is rather disappointing, after the pic-
tures. Few things, I have noticed, come quite up to the pictures 
of them, in this world.

We passed through Iffley Lock at about half-past twelve, and 
then, having tidied up the boat and made all ready for landing, 
we set to work on our last mile.

Between  Iffley  and  Oxford  is  the  most  difficult  bit  of  the 
river I know. You want to be born on that bit of water, to un-
derstand it. I have been over it a fairish number of times, but I 
have never been able to get the hang of it. The man who could 
row a straight course from Oxford to Iffley ought to be able to 
live comfortably, under one roof, with his wife, his mother-in-
law, his elder sister, and the old servant who was in the family 
when he was a baby.

First the current drives you on to the right bank, and then 
on to the left, then it takes you out into the middle, turns you 

— 188 —

round three times, and carries you up stream again, and always 
ends by trying to smash you up against a college barge.

Of  course,  as  a  consequence  of  this,  we  got  in  the  way  of 
a good many other boats, during the mile, and they in ours, 
and, of course, as a consequence of that, a good deal of bad 
language occurred.

I don’t know why it should be, but everybody is always so 
exceptionally  irritable  on  the  river.  Little  mishaps,  that  you 
would hardly notice on dry land, drive you nearly frantic with 
rage, when they occur on the water. When Harris or George 
makes an ass of himself on dry land, I smile indulgently; when 
they behave in a chuckle-head way on the river, I use the most 
blood-curdling language to them. When another boat gets in 
my way, I feel I want to take an oar and kill all the people in 
it.

The mildest tempered people, when on land, become violent 
and blood-thirsty when in a boat. I did a little boating once 
with a young lady. She was naturally of the sweetest and gen-
tlest disposition imaginable, but on the river it was quite awful 
to hear her.

“Oh, drat the man!” she would exclaim, when some unfor-
tunate sculler would get in her way; “why don’t he look where 
he’s going?”

And, “Oh, bother the silly old thing!” she would say indig-
nantly, when the sail would not go up properly. And she would 
catch hold of it, and shake it quite brutally.

Yet, as I have said, when on shore she was kind-hearted and 

amiable enough.

The  air  of  the  river  has  a  demoralising  effect  upon  one’s 
temper, and this it is, I suppose, which causes even barge men 
to  be  sometimes  rude  to  one  another,  and  to  use  language 
which, no doubt, in their calmer moments they regret.

CHAPTER XIX.

Oxford. — Montmorency’s  idea  of  Heaven. — The  hired  up-river 
boat, its beauties and advantages. — The “Pride of the Thames.” — 
The weather changes. — The river under different aspects. — Not a 
cheerful evening. — Yearnings for the unattainable. — The cheery 
chat goes round. — George performs upon the banjo. — A mourn-
ful  melody. — Another  wet  day. — Flight. — A  little  supper  and  a 

toast.

WE spent two very pleasant days at Oxford. There are plenty 
of dogs in the town of Oxford. Montmorency had eleven fights 
on  the  first  day,  and  fourteen  on  the  second,  and  evidently 
thought he had got to heaven.

Among folk too constitutionally weak, or too constitution-
ally lazy, whichever it may be, to relish up-stream work, it is a 
common practice to get a boat at Oxford, and row down. For 
the energetic, however, the up-stream journey is certainly to be 
preferred. It does not seem good to be always going with the 
current. There is more satisfaction in squaring one’s back, and 
fighting against it, and winning one’s way forward in spite of 
it — at least, so I feel, when Harris and George are sculling and 
I am steering.

To  those  who  do  contemplate  making  Oxford  their  start-
ing-place, I would say, take your own boat — unless, of course, 
you  can  take  someone  else’s  without  any  possible  danger  of 
being found out. The boats that, as a rule, are let for hire on 
the  Thames  above  Marlow,  are  very  good  boats.  They  are 
fairly water-tight; and so long as they are handled with care, 
they rarely come to pieces, or sink. There are places in them 
to sit down on, and they are complete with all the necessary 
arrangements — or nearly all — to enable you to row them and 
steer them.

But they are not ornamental. The boat you hire up the river 
above Marlow is not the sort of boat in which you can flash 
about  and  give  yourself  airs.  The  hired  up-river  boat  very 
soon puts a stop to any nonsense of that sort on the part of 

— 190 —

its occupants. That is its chief — one may say, its only recom-
mendation.

The man in the hired up-river boat is modest and retiring. 
He likes to keep on the shady side, underneath the trees, and to 
do most of his travelling early in the morning or late at night, 
when there are not many people about on the river to look at 
him.

When  the  man  in  the  hired  up-river  boat  sees  anyone  he 

knows, he gets out on to the bank, and hides behind a tree.

I was one of a party who hired an up-river boat one sum-
mer, for a few days’ trip. We had none of us ever seen the hired 
up-river boat before; and we did not know what it was when 
we did see it.

We  had  written  for  a  boat — a  double  sculling  skiff;  and 
when we went down with our bags to the yard, and gave our 
names, the man said:

“Oh, yes; you’re the party that wrote for a double sculling 

skiff. It’s all right. Jim, fetch round The Pride of the Thames.”

The  boy  went,  and  re-appeared  five  minutes  afterwards, 
struggling  with  an  antediluvian  chunk  of  wood,  that  looked 
as though it had been recently dug out of somewhere, and dug 
out carelessly, so as to have been unnecessarily damaged in the 
process.

My own idea, on first catching sight of the object, was that it 
was a Roman relic of some sort, — relic of what I do not know, 
possibly of a coffin.

The neighbourhood of the upper Thames is rich in Roman 
relics,  and  my  surmise  seemed  to  me  a  very  probable  one; 
but our serious young man, who is a bit of a geologist, pooh-
poohed  my  Roman  relic  theory,  and  said  it  was  clear  to  the 
meanest intellect (in which category he seemed to be grieved 
that he could not conscientiously include mine) that the thing 
the boy had found was the fossil of a whale; and he pointed out 
to us various evidences proving that it must have belonged to 
the preglacial period.

To settle the dispute, we appealed to the boy. We told him 

— 191 —

not to be afraid, but to speak the plain truth: Was it the fossil of 
a pre-Adamite whale, or was it an early Roman coffin?

The boy said it was The Pride of the Thames.
We thought this a very humorous answer on the part of the 
boy at first, and somebody gave him twopence as a reward for 
his ready wit; but when he persisted in keeping up the joke, as 
we thought, too long, we got vexed with him.

“Come, come, my lad!” said our captain sharply, “don’t let us 
have any nonsense. You take your mother’s washing-tub home 
again, and bring us a boat.”

The  boat-builder  himself  came  up  then,  and  assured  us, 
on  his  word,  as  a  practical  man,  that  the  thing  really  was  a 
boat — was, in fact, the boat, the “double sculling skiff ” selected 
to take us on our trip down the river.

We  grumbled  a  good  deal. We  thought  he  might,  at  least, 
have  had  it  whitewashed  or  tarred — had  something  done  to 
it to distinguish it from a bit of a wreck; but he could not see 
any fault in it.

He even seemed offended at our remarks. He said he had 
picked us out the best boat in all his stock, and he thought we 
might have been more grateful.

He said it, The Pride of the Thames, had been in use, just as 
it now stood (or rather as it now hung together), for the last 
forty years, to his knowledge, and nobody had complained of it 
before, and he did not see why we should be the first to begin.

We argued no more.
We  fastened  the  so-called  boat  together  with  some  pieces 
of string, got a bit of wall-paper and pasted over the shabbier 
places, said our prayers, and stepped on board.

They  charged  us  thirty-five  shillings  for  the  loan  of  the 
remnant for six days; and we could have bought the thing out-
and-out for four-and-sixpence at any sale of drift-wood round 
the coast.

The weather changed on the third day, — Oh! I am talking 
about  our  present  trip  now, — and  we  started  from  Oxford 
upon our homeward journey in the midst of a steady drizzle.

— 192 —

The  river — with  the  sunlight  flashing  from  its  dancing 
wavelets,  gilding  gold  the  grey-green  beech-trunks,  glinting 
through the dark, cool wood paths, chasing shadows o’er the 
shallows,  flinging  diamonds  from  the  mill-wheels,  throwing 
kisses to the lilies, wantoning with the weirs’ white waters, sil-
vering moss-grown walls and bridges, brightening every tiny 
townlet, making sweet each lane and meadow, lying tangled in 
the  rushes,  peeping,  laughing,  from  each  inlet,  gleaming  gay 
on many a far sail, making soft the air with glory — is a golden 
fairy stream.

But the river — chill and weary, with the ceaseless rain-drops 
falling on its brown and sluggish waters, with a sound as of a 
woman, weeping low in some dark chamber; while the woods, 
all  dark  and  silent,  shrouded  in  their  mists  of  vapour,  stand 
like ghosts upon the margin; silent ghosts with eyes reproach-
ful,  like  the  ghosts  of  evil  actions,  like  the  ghosts  of  friends 
neglected — is a spirit-haunted water through the land of vain 
regrets.

Sunlight is the life-blood of Nature. Mother Earth looks at 
us  with  such  dull,  soulless  eyes,  when  the  sunlight  has  died 
away from out of her. It makes us sad to be with her then; she 
does not seem to know us or to care for us. She is as a widow 
who has lost the husband she loved, and her children touch her 
hand, and look up into her eyes, but gain no smile from her.

We rowed on all that day through the rain, and very melan-
choly work it was. We pretended, at first, that we enjoyed it. We 
said it was a change, and that we liked to see the river under 
all its different aspects. We said we could not expect to have 
it all sunshine, nor should we wish it. We told each other that 
Nature was beautiful, even in her tears.

Indeed, Harris and I were quite enthusiastic about the busi-
ness, for the first few hours. And we sang a song about a gipsy’s 
life, and how delightful a gipsy’s existence was! — free to storm 
and sunshine, and to every wind that blew! — and how he en-
joyed the rain, and what a lot of good it did him; and how he 
laughed at people who didn’t like it.

— 193 —

George  took  the  fun  more  soberly,  and  stuck  to  the  um-

brella.

We hoisted the cover before we had lunch, and kept it up 
all the afternoon, just leaving a little space in the bow, from 
which one of us could paddle and keep a look-out. In this way 
we made nine miles, and pulled up for the night a little below 
Day’s Lock.

I cannot honestly say that we had a merry evening. The rain 
poured  down  with  quiet  persistency.  Everything  in  the  boat 
was damp and clammy. Supper was not a success. Cold veal pie, 
when you don’t feel hungry, is apt to cloy. I felt I wanted white-
bait and a cutlet; Harris babbled of soles and white-sauce, and 
passed the remains of his pie to Montmorency, who declined 
it, and, apparently insulted by the offer, went and sat over at the 
other end of the boat by himself.

George requested that we would not talk about these things, 
at all events until he had finished his cold boiled beef without 
mustard.

We played penny nap after supper. We played for about an 
hour  and  a  half,  by  the  end  of  which  time  George  had  won 
fourpence — George always is lucky at cards — and Harris and 
I had lost exactly twopence each.

We  thought  we  would  give  up  gambling  then.  As  Harris 
said, it breeds an unhealthy excitement when carried too far. 
George offered to go on and give us our revenge; but Harris 
and I decided not to battle any further against Fate.

After that, we mixed ourselves some toddy, and sat round 
and talked. George told us about a man he had known, who 
had come up the river two years ago and who had slept out in 
a damp boat on just such another night as that was, and it had 
given him rheumatic fever, and nothing was able to save him, 
and  he  had  died  in  great  agony  ten  days  afterwards.  George 
said he was quite a young man, and was engaged to be married. 
He said it was one of the saddest things he had ever known.

And that put Harris in mind of a friend of his, who had been 
in the Volunteers, and who had slept out under canvas one wet 

— 194 —

night down at Aldershot, “on just such another night as this,” 
said Harris; and he had woke up in the morning a cripple for 
life. Harris said he would introduce us both to the man when 
we got back to town; it would make our hearts bleed to see 
him.

This naturally led to some pleasant chat about sciatica, fe-
vers, chills, lung diseases, and bronchitis; and Harris said how 
very awkward it would be if one of us were taken seriously ill 
in the night, seeing how far away we were from a doctor.

There seemed to be a desire for something frolicksome to 
follow upon this conversation, and in a weak moment I sug-
gested that George should get out his banjo, and see if he could 
not give us a comic song.

I  will  say  for  George  that  he  did  not  want  any  pressing. 
There was no nonsense about having left his music at home, or 
anything of that sort. He at once fished out his instrument, and 
commenced to play “Two Lovely Black Eyes.”

I had always regarded “Two Lovely Black Eyes” as rather a 
commonplace tune until that evening. The rich vein of sadness 
that George extracted from it quite surprised me.

The desire that grew upon Harris and myself, as the mourn-
ful strains progressed, was to fall upon each other’s necks and 
weep;  but  by  great  effort  we  kept  back  the  rising  tears,  and 
listened to the wild yearnful melody in silence.

When the chorus came we even made a desperate effort to 
be merry. We re-filled our glasses and joined in; Harris, in a 
voice trembling with emotion, leading, and George and I fol-
lowing a few words behind:

“Two lovely black eyes;
Oh! what a surprise!
Only for telling a man he was wrong,
Two —”

There we broke down. The unutterable pathos of George’s 
accompaniment to that “two” we were, in our then state of de-

— 195 —

pression, unable to bear. Harris sobbed like a little child, and 
the dog howled till I thought his heart or his jaw must surely 
break.

George wanted to go on with another verse. He thought that 
when he had got a little more into the tune, and could throw 
more “abandon,”  as  it  were,  into  the  rendering,  it  might  not 
seem so sad. The feeling of the majority, however, was opposed 
to the experiment.

There  being  nothing  else  to  do,  we  went  to  bed — that  is, 
we undressed ourselves, and tossed about at the bottom of the 
boat for some three or four hours. After which, we managed to 
get some fitful slumber until five a.m., when we all got up and 
had breakfast.

The second day was exactly like the first. The rain continued 
to pour down, and we sat, wrapped up in our mackintoshes, 
underneath the canvas, and drifted slowly down.

One of us — I forget which one now, but I rather think it was 
myself — made a few feeble attempts during the course of the 
morning to work up the old gipsy foolishness about being chil-
dren of Nature and enjoying the wet; but it did not go down 
well at all. That —

“I care not for the rain, not I!”

was so painfully evident, as expressing the sentiments of each 
of us, that to sing it seemed unnecessary.

On one point we were all agreed, and that was that, come 
what might, we would go through with this job to the bitter 
end. We had come out for a fortnight’s enjoyment on the river, 
and a fortnight’s enjoyment on the river we meant to have. If 
it killed us! well, that would be a sad thing for our friends and 
relations, but it could not be helped. We felt that to give in to 
the weather in a climate such as ours would be a most disas-
trous precedent.

“It’s only two days more,” said Harris, “and we are young and 

strong. We may get over it all right, after all.”

— 196 —

At about four o’clock we began to discuss our arrangements 
for the evening. We were a little past Goring then, and we de-
cided to paddle on to Pangbourne, and put up there for the 
night.

“Another jolly evening!” murmured George.
We sat and mused on the prospect. We should be in at Pan-
gbourne by five. We should finish dinner at, say, half-past six. 
After that we could walk about the village in the pouring rain 
until bed-time; or we could sit in a dimly-lit bar-parlour and 
read the almanac.

“Why,  the  Alhambra  would  be  almost  more  lively,”  said 
Harris, venturing his head outside the cover for a moment and 
taking a survey of the sky.

“With a little supper at the — * to follow,” I added, half un-

consciously.

“Yes it’s almost a pity we’ve made up our minds to stick to 
this boat,” answered Harris; and then there was silence for a 
while.

“If  we  hadn’t  made  up  our  minds  to  contract  our  certain 
deaths  in  this  bally  old  coffin,”  observed  George,  casting  a 
glance  of  intense  malevolence  over  the  boat,  “it  might  be 
worth while to mention that there’s a train leaves Pangbourne, 
I know, soon after five, which would just land us in town in 
comfortable time to get a chop, and then go on to the place you 
mentioned afterwards.”

Nobody  spoke.  We  looked  at  one  another,  and  each  one 
seemed to see his own mean and guilty thoughts reflected in 
the faces of the others. In silence, we dragged out and over-
hauled the Gladstone. We looked up the river and down the 
river; not a soul was in sight!

Twenty minutes later, three figures, followed by a shamed-

* A capital little out-of-the-way restaurant, in the neighbourhood of —, 
where you can get one of the best-cooked and cheapest little French 
dinners or suppers that I know of, with an excellent bottle of Beaune, 
for  three-and-six;  and  which  I  am  not  going  to  be  idiot  enough  to 
advertise.

— 197 —

looking dog, might have been seen creeping stealthily from the 
boat-house at the “Swan” towards the railway station, dressed 
in the following neither neat nor gaudy costume:

Black  leather  shoes,  dirty;  suit  of  boating  flannels,  very 
dirty;  brown  felt  hat,  much  battered;  mackintosh,  very  wet; 
umbrella.

We had deceived the boatman at Pangbourne. We had not 
had the face to tell him that we were running away from the 
rain. We had left the boat, and all it contained, in his charge, 
with instructions that it was to be ready for us at nine the next 
morning. If, we said — if anything unforeseen should happen, 
preventing our return, we would write to him.

We  reached  Paddington  at  seven,  and  drove  direct  to  the 
restaurant I have before described, where we partook of a light 
meal, left Montmorency, together with suggestions for a sup-
per to be ready at half-past ten, and then continued our way to 
Leicester Square.

We attracted a good deal of attention at the Alhambra. On 
our  presenting  ourselves  at  the  paybox  we  were  gruffly  di-
rected to go round to Castle Street, and were informed that we 
were half-an-hour behind our time.

We convinced the man, with some difficulty, that we were 
not “the  world-renowned  contortionists  from  the  Himalaya 
Mountains,” and he took our money and let us pass.

Inside  we  were  a  still  greater  success.  Our  fine  bronzed 
countenances  and  picturesque  clothes  were  followed  round 
the place with admiring gaze. We were the cynosure of every 
eye.

It was a proud moment for us all.
We  adjourned  soon  after  the  first  ballet,  and  wended  our 
way back to the restaurant, where supper was already awaiting 
us.

I must confess to enjoying that supper. For about ten days 
we seemed to have been living, more or less, on nothing but 
cold meat, cake, and bread and jam. It had been a simple, a nu-
tritious diet; but there had been nothing exciting about it, and 

— 198 —

the odour of Burgundy, and the smell of French sauces, and 
the sight of clean napkins and long loaves, knocked as a very 
welcome visitor at the door of our inner man.

We  pegged  and  quaffed  away  in  silence  for  a  while,  until 
the time came when, instead of sitting bolt upright, and grasp-
ing the knife and fork firmly, we leant back in our chairs and 
worked  slowly  and  carelessly — when  we  stretched  out  our 
legs beneath the table, let our napkins fall, unheeded, to the 
floor,  and  found  time  to  more  critically  examine  the  smoky 
ceiling than we had hitherto been able to do — when we rested 
our glasses at arm’s-length upon the table, and felt good, and 
thoughtful, and forgiving.

Then Harris, who was sitting next the window, drew aside 

the curtain and looked out upon the street.

It glistened darkly in the wet, the dim lamps flickered with 
each  gust,  the  rain  splashed  steadily  into  the  puddles  and 
trickled down the water-spouts into the running gutters. A few 
soaked wayfarers hurried past, crouching beneath their drip-
ping umbrellas, the women holding up their skirts.

“Well,” said Harris, reaching his hand out for his glass, “we 
have  had  a  pleasant  trip,  and  my  hearty  thanks  for  it  to  old 
Father Thames — but I think we did well to chuck it when we 
did. Here’s to Three Men well out of a Boat!”

And  Montmorency,  standing  on  his  hind  legs,  before  the 
window, peering out into the night, gave a short bark of de-
cided concurrence with the toast.

THREE MEN ON THE BUMMEL

CHAPTER I

Three men need change — Anecdote showing evil result of decep-
tion — Moral  cowardice  of  George — Harris  has  ideas — Yarn  of 
the Ancient Mariner and the Inexperienced Yachtsman — A hearty 
crew — Danger of sailing when the wind is off the land — Impossi-
bility of sailing when the wind is off the sea — The argumentative-
ness of Ethelbertha — The dampness of the river — Harris suggests 
a bicycle tour — George thinks of the wind — Harris suggests the 
Black Forest — George thinks of the hills — Plan adopted by Harris 

for ascent of hills — Interruption by Mrs. Harris.

“WHAT we want,” said Harris, “is a change.”

At this moment the door opened, and Mrs. Harris put her 
head in to say that Ethelbertha had sent her to remind me that 
we must not be late getting home because of Clarence. Ethel-
bertha, I am inclined to think, is unnecessarily nervous about 
the  children.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  there  was  nothing  wrong 
with the child whatever. He had been out with his aunt that 
morning; and if he looks wistfully at a pastrycook’s window 
she takes him inside and buys him cream buns and “maids-of-
honour” until he insists that he has had enough, and politely, 
but firmly, refuses to eat another anything. Then, of course, he 
wants only one helping of pudding at lunch, and Ethelbertha 
thinks he is sickening for something. Mrs. Harris added that 
it would be as well for us to come upstairs soon, on our own 
account also, as otherwise we should miss Muriel’s rendering 
of “The Mad Hatter’s Tea Party,” out of Alice in Wonderland. 
Muriel is Harris’s second, age eight: she is a bright, intelligent 
child;  but  I  prefer  her  myself  in  serious  pieces. We  said  we 
would  finish  our  cigarettes  and  follow  almost  immediately; 
we also begged her not to let Muriel begin until we arrived. 
She promised to hold the child back as long as possible, and 
went. Harris, as soon as the door was closed, resumed his in-
terrupted sentence.

“You know what I mean,” he said, “a complete change.”
The question was how to get it.
George suggested “business.” It was the sort of suggestion 

— 202 —

George  would  make.  A  bachelor  thinks  a  married  woman 
doesn’t know enough to get out of the way of a steam-roller. I 
knew a young fellow once, an engineer, who thought he would 
go  to Vienna “on  business.”  His  wife  wanted  to  know “what 
business?” He told her it would be his duty to visit the mines 
in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  Austrian  capital,  and  to  make 
reports.  She  said  she  would  go  with  him;  she  was  that  sort 
of woman. He tried to dissuade her: he told her that a mine 
was no place for a beautiful woman. She said she felt that her-
self, and that therefore she did not intend to accompany him 
down the shafts; she would see him off in the morning, and 
then amuse herself until his return, looking round the Vienna 
shops, and buying a few things she might want. Having started 
the idea, he did not see very well how to get out of it; and for 
ten long summer days he did visit the mines in the neighbour-
hood of Vienna, and in the evening wrote reports about them, 
which she posted for him to his firm, who didn’t want them.

I should be grieved to think that either Ethelbertha or Mrs. 
Harris belonged to that class of wife, but it is as well not to 
overdo “business” — it should be kept for cases of real emer-
gency.

“No,” I said, “the thing is to be frank and manly. I shall tell 
Ethelbertha that I have come to the conclusion a man never 
values happiness that is always with him. I shall tell her that, 
for the sake of learning to appreciate my own advantages as I 
know they should be appreciated, I intend to tear myself away 
from her and the children for at least three weeks. I shall tell 
her,” I continued, turning to Harris, “that it is you who have 
shown me my duty in this respect; that it is to you we shall 
owe —”

Harris put down his glass rather hurriedly.
“If  you  don’t  mind,  old  man,”  he  interrupted,  “I’d  really 
rather you didn’t. She’ll talk it over with my wife, and — well, I 
should not be happy, taking credit that I do not deserve.”

“But you do deserve it,” I insisted; “it was your suggestion.”
“It was you gave me the idea,” interrupted Harris again. “You 

— 203 —

know you said it was a mistake for a man to get into a groove, 
and that unbroken domesticity cloyed the brain.”

“I was speaking generally,” I explained.
“It struck me as very apt,” said Harris. “I thought of repeat-
ing it to Clara; she has a great opinion of your sense, I know. I 
am sure that if —”

“We won’t risk it,” I interrupted, in my turn; “it is a delicate 
matter, and I see a way out of it. We will say George suggested 
the idea.”

There  is  a  lack  of  genial  helpfulness  about  George  that  it 
sometimes  vexes  me  to  notice.  You  would  have  thought  he 
would have welcomed the chance of assisting two old friends 
out of a dilemma; instead, he became disagreeable.

“You do,” said George, “and I shall tell them both that my 
original plan was that we should make a party — children and 
all;  that  I  should  bring  my  aunt,  and  that  we  should  hire  a 
charming old château I know of in Normandy, on the coast, 
where  the  climate  is  peculiarly  adapted  to  delicate  children, 
and the milk such as you do not get in England. I shall add that 
you over-rode that suggestion, arguing we should be happier 
by ourselves.”

With a man like George kindness is of no use; you have to 

be firm.

“You do,” said Harris, “and I, for one, will close with the of-
fer. We will just take that château. You will bring your aunt — I 
will see to that, — and we will have a month of it. The children 
are all fond of you; J. and I will be nowhere. You’ve promised 
to  teach  Edgar  fishing;  and  it  is  you  who  will  have  to  play 
wild  beasts.  Since  last  Sunday  Dick  and  Muriel  have  talked 
of nothing else but your hippopotamus. We will picnic in the 
woods — there will only be eleven of us, — and in the evenings 
we  will  have  music  and  recitations.  Muriel  is  master  of  six 
pieces already, as perhaps you know; and all the other children 
are quick studies.”

George climbed down — he has no real courage — but he did 
not do it gracefully. He said that if we were mean and cowardly 

— 204 —

and false-hearted enough to stoop to such a shabby trick, he 
supposed he couldn’t help it; and that if I didn’t intend to fin-
ish the whole bottle of claret myself, he would trouble me to 
spare him a glass. He also added, somewhat illogically, that it 
really did not matter, seeing both Ethelbertha and Mrs. Harris 
were women of sense who would judge him better than to be-
lieve for a moment that the suggestion emanated from him.

This  little  point  settled,  the  question  was: What  sort  of  a 

change?

Harris, as usual, was for the sea. He said he knew a yacht, 
just the very thing — one that we could manage by ourselves; 
no skulking lot of lubbers loafing about, adding to the expense 
and taking away from the romance. Give him a handy boy, he 
would sail it himself. We knew that yacht, and we told him so; 
we had been on it with Harris before. It smells of bilge-water 
and  greens  to  the  exclusion  of  all  other  scents;  no  ordinary 
sea air can hope to head against it. So far as sense of smell is 
concerned, one might be spending a week in Limehouse Hole. 
There is no place to get out of the rain; the saloon is ten feet 
by four, and half of that is taken up by a stove, which falls to 
pieces when you go to light it. You have to take your bath on 
deck,  and  the  towel  blows  overboard  just  as  you  step  out  of 
the tub. Harris and the boy do all the interesting work — the 
lugging and the reefing, the letting her go and the heeling her 
over, and all that sort of thing, — leaving George and myself to 
do the peeling of the potatoes and the washing up.

“Very well, then,” said Harris, “let’s take a proper yacht, with 

a skipper, and do the thing in style.”

That also I objected to. I know that skipper; his notion of 
yachting is to lie in what he calls the “offing,” where he can be 
well in touch with his wife and family, to say nothing of his 
favourite public-house.

Years ago, when I was young and inexperienced, I hired a 
yacht myself. Three things had combined to lead me into this 
foolishness: I had had a stroke of unexpected luck; Ethelbertha 
had expressed a yearning for sea air; and the very next morn-

— 205 —

ing, in taking up casually at the club a copy of the Sportsman, I 
had come across the following advertisement:—

TO  YACHTSMEN.   —  Unique  Opportunity.  —  “Rogue,” 
28-ton Yawl. — Owner, called away suddenly on business, 
is  willing  to  let  this  superbly-fitted  “greyhound  of  the 
sea” for any period short or long. Two cabins and saloon; 
pianette, by Woffenkoff; new copper. Terms, 10 guineas a 
week. — Apply Pertwee and Co., 3A Bucklersbury.

It had seemed to me like the answer to a prayer. “The new 
copper” did not interest me; what little washing we might want 
could wait, I thought. But the “pianette by Woffenkoff ” sound-
ed  alluring.  I  pictured  Ethelbertha  playing  in  the  evening — 
something with a chorus, in which, perhaps, the crew, with a 
little training, might join — while our moving home bounded, 
“greyhound-like,” over the silvery billows.

I took a cab and drove direct to 3A Bucklersbury. Mr. Pert-
wee  was  an  unpretentious-looking  gentleman,  who  had  an 
unostentatious office on the third floor. He showed me a pic-
ture in water-colours of the Rogue flying before the wind. The 
deck was at an angle of 95 to the ocean. In the picture no hu-
man beings were represented on the deck; I suppose they had 
slipped off. Indeed, I do not see how anyone could have kept 
on, unless nailed. I pointed out this disadvantage to the agent, 
who, however, explained to me that the picture represented the 
Rogue doubling something or other on the well-known occa-
sion of her winning the Medway Challenge Shield. Mr. Pertwee 
assumed that I knew all about the event, so that I did not like 
to ask any questions. Two specks near the frame of the picture, 
which at first I had taken for moths, represented, it appeared, 
the second and third winners in this celebrated race. A photo-
graph of the yacht at anchor off Gravesend was less impressive, 
but suggested more stability. All answers to my inquiries being 
satisfactory, I took the thing for a fortnight. Mr. Pertwee said it 
was fortunate I wanted it only for a fortnight — later on I came 

— 206 —

to agree with him, — the time fitting in exactly with another 
hiring. Had I required it for three weeks he would have been 
compelled to refuse me.

The letting being thus arranged, Mr. Pertwee asked me if I 
had a skipper in my eye. That I had not was also fortunate — 
things seemed to be turning out luckily for me all round, — be-
cause Mr. Pertwee felt sure I could not do better than keep on 
Mr. Goyles, at present in charge — an excellent skipper, so Mr. 
Pertwee assured me, a man who knew the sea as a man knows 
his own wife, and who had never lost a life.

It  was  still  early  in  the  day,  and  the  yacht  was  lying  off 
Harwich.  I  caught  the  ten  forty-five  from  Liverpool  Street, 
and by one o’clock was talking to Mr. Goyles on deck. He was 
a stout man, and had a fatherly way with him. I told him my 
idea, which was to take the outlying Dutch islands and then 
creep up to Norway. He said, “Aye, aye, sir,” and appeared quite 
enthusiastic  about  the  trip;  said  he  should  enjoy  it  himself. 
We  came  to  the  question  of  victualling,  and  he  grew  more 
enthusiastic. The amount of food suggested by Mr. Goyles, I 
confess, surprised me. Had we been living in the days of Drake 
and the Spanish Main, I should have feared he was arranging 
for something illegal. However, he laughed in his fatherly way, 
and  assured  me  we  were  not  overdoing  it. Anything  left  the 
crew would divide and take home with them — it seemed this 
was the custom. It appeared to me that I was providing for this 
crew for the winter, but I did not like to appear stingy, and said 
no more. The amount of drink required also surprised me. I 
arranged for what I thought we should need for ourselves, and 
then Mr. Goyles spoke up for the crew. I must say that for him, 
he did think of his men.

“We  don’t  want  anything  in  the  nature  of  an  orgie,  Mr. 

Goyles,” I suggested.

treat them well.

“Orgie!”  replied  Mr.  Goyles;  “why  they’ll  take  that  little 

He explained to me that his motto was, Get good men and 

— 207 —

“They work better for you,” said Mr. Goyles; “and they come 

again.”

Personally, I didn’t feel I wanted them to come again. I was 
beginning to take a dislike to them before I had seen them; I 
regarded them as a greedy and guzzling crew. But Mr. Goyles 
was so cheerfully emphatic, and I was so inexperienced, that 
again  I  let  him  have  his  way.  He  also  promised  that  even  in 
this department he would see to it personally that nothing was 
wasted.

I also left him to engage the crew. He said he could do the 
thing, and would, for me, with the help two men and a boy. If 
he was alluding to the clearing up of the victuals and drink, I 
think he was making an under-estimate; but possibly he may 
have been speaking of the sailing of the yacht.

I called at my tailors on the way home and ordered a yacht-
ing suit, with a white hat, which they promised to bustle up 
and have ready in time; and then I went home and told Ethel-
bertha  all  I  had  done.  Her  delight  was  clouded  by  only  one 
reflection — would the dressmaker be able to finish a yachting 
costume for her in time? That is so like a woman.

Our honeymoon, which had taken place not very long be-
fore, had been somewhat curtailed, so we decided we would 
invite nobody, but have the yacht to ourselves. And thankful 
I am to Heaven that we did so decide. On Monday we put on 
all our clothes and started. I forget what Ethelbertha wore, but, 
whatever it may have been, it looked very fetching. My own 
costume was a dark blue trimmed with a narrow white braid, 
which, I think, was rather effective.

Mr.  Goyles  met  us  on  deck,  and  told  us  that  lunch  was 
ready. I must admit Goyles had secured the services of a very 
fair cook. The capabilities of the other members of the crew I 
had no opportunity of judging. Speaking of them in a state of 
rest, however, I can say of them they appeared to be a cheerful 
crew.

My  idea  had  been  that  so  soon  as  the  men  had  finished 
their dinner we would weigh anchor, while I, smoking a cigar, 

— 208 —

with Ethelbertha by my side, would lean over the gunwale and 
watch the white cliffs of the Fatherland sink imperceptibly into 
the horizon. Ethelbertha and I carried out our part of the pro-
gramme, and waited, with the deck to ourselves.

“They seem to be taking their time,” said Ethelbertha.
“If, in the course of fourteen days,” I said, “they eat half of 
what is on this yacht, they will want a fairly long time for every 
meal. We had better not hurry them, or they won’t get through 
a quarter of it.”

“They must have gone to sleep,” said Ethelbertha, later on. 

“It will be tea-time soon.”

They  were  certainly  very  quiet.  I  went  for’ard,  and  hailed 
Captain  Goyles  down  the  ladder.  I  hailed  him  three  times; 
then he came up slowly. He appeared to be a heavier and older 
man than when I had seen him last. He had a cold cigar in his 
mouth.

“When you are ready, Captain Goyles,” I said, “we’ll start.”
Captain Goyles removed the cigar from his mouth.
“Not  to-day  we  won’t,  sir,”  he  replied, “with  your  permis-

sion.”

“Why, what’s the matter with to-day?” I said. I know sailors 
are a superstitious folk; I thought maybe a Monday might be 
considered unlucky.

“The day’s all right,” answered Captain Goyles, “it’s the wind 

I’m a-thinking of. It don’t look much like changing.”

“But do we want it to change?” I asked. “It seems to me to be 

just where it should be, dead behind us.”

“Aye, aye,” said Captain Goyles, “dead’s the right word to use, 
for dead we’d all be, bar Providence, if we was to put out in this. 
You see, sir,” he explained, in answer to my look of surprise, 
“this is what we call a ‘land wind,’ that is, it’s a-blowing, as one 
might say, direct off the land.”

When I came to think of it the man was right; the wind was 

blowing off the land.

“It  may  change  in  the  night,”  said  Captain  Goyles,  more 

hopefully “anyhow, it’s not violent, and she rides well.”

— 209 —

Captain Goyles resumed his cigar, and I returned aft, and 
explained  to  Ethelbertha  the  reason  for  the  delay.  Ethelber-
tha, who appeared to be less high spirited than when we first 
boarded, wanted to know why we couldn’t sail when the wind 
was off the land.

“If  it  was  not  blowing  off  the  land,”  said  Ethelbertha, “it 
would  be  blowing  off  the  sea,  and  that  would  send  us  back 
into the shore again. It seems to me this is just the very wind 
we want.”

I said: “That is your inexperience, love; it seems to be the 
very wind we want, but it is not. It’s what we call a land wind, 
and a land wind is always very dangerous.”

Ethelbertha wanted to know why a land wind was very dan-

gerous.

Her argumentativeness annoyed me somewhat; maybe I was 
feeling  a  bit  cross;  the  monotonous  rolling  heave  of  a  small 
yacht at anchor depresses an ardent spirit.

“I can’t explain it to you,” I replied, which was true, “but to 
set sail in this wind would be the height of foolhardiness, and 
I care for you too much, dear, to expose you to unnecessary 
risks.”

I  thought  this  rather  a  neat  conclusion,  but  Ethelbertha 
merely replied that she wished, under the circumstances, we 
hadn’t come on board till Tuesday, and went below.

In the morning the wind veered round to the north; I was 

up early, and observed this to Captain Goyles.

“Aye, aye, sir,” he remarked; “it’s unfortunate, but it can’t be 

“You don’t think it possible for us to start to-day?” I haz-

helped.”

arded.

He did not get angry with me, he only laughed.
“Well, sir,” said he, “if you was a-wanting to go to Ipswich, 
I should say as it couldn’t be better for us, but our destination 
being, as you see, the Dutch coast — why there you are!”

I broke the news to Ethelbertha, and we agreed to spend the 
day on shore. Harwich is not a merry town, towards evening 

— 210 —

you might call it dull. We had some tea and watercress at Do-
vercourt, and then returned to the quay to look for Captain 
Goyles  and  the  boat. We  waited  an  hour  for  him. When  he 
came he was more cheerful than we were; if he had not told 
me himself that he never drank anything but one glass of hot 
grog before turning in for the night, I should have said he was 
drunk.

The next morning the wind was in the south, which made 
Captain Goyles rather anxious, it appearing that it was equally 
unsafe to move or to stop where we were; our only hope was it 
would change before anything happened. By this time, Ethel-
bertha had taken a dislike to the yacht; she said that, personal-
ly, she would rather be spending a week in a bathing machine, 
seeing that a bathing machine was at least steady.

We passed another day in Harwich, and that night and the 
next,  the  wind  still  continuing  in  the  south,  we  slept  at  the 
“King’s Head.” On Friday the wind was blowing direct from 
the east. I met Captain Goyles on the quay, and suggested that, 
under these circumstances, we might start. He appeared irri-
tated at my persistence.

“If you knew a bit more, sir,” he said, “you’d see for yourself 

that it’s impossible. The wind’s a-blowing direct off the sea.”

I  said: “Captain  Goyles,  tell  me  what  is  this  thing  I  have 

hired? Is it a yacht or a house-boat?”

He seemed surprised at my question.
He said: “It’s a yawl.”
“What I mean is,” I said, “can it be moved at all, or is it a 
fixture here? If it is a fixture,” I continued, “tell me so frankly, 
then  we  will  get  some  ivy  in  boxes  and  train  over  the  port-
holes, stick some flowers and an awning on deck, and make the 
thing look pretty. If, on the other hand, it can be moved —”

“Moved!”  interrupted  Captain  Goyles. “You  get  the  right 

wind behind the Rogue — ”

I said: “What is the right wind?”
Captain Goyles looked puzzled.
“In the course of this week,” I went on, “we have had wind 

— 211 —

from  the  north,  from  the  south,  from  the  east,  from  the 
west — with variations. If you can think of any other point of 
the compass from which it can blow, tell me, and I will wait for 
it. If not, and if that anchor has not grown into the bottom of 
the ocean, we will have it up to-day and see what happens.”

He grasped the fact that I was determined.
“Very  well,  sir,”  he  said, “you’re  master  and  I’m  man.  I’ve 
only got one child as is still dependent on me, thank God, and 
no doubt your executors will feel it their duty to do the right 
thing by the old woman.”

His solemnity impressed me.
“Mr. Goyles,” I said, “be honest with me. Is there any hope, 

in any weather, of getting away from this damned hole?”

Captain Goyles’s kindly geniality returned to him.
“You  see,  sir,”  he  said, “this  is  a  very  peculiar  coast. We’d 
be all right if we were once out, but getting away from it in a 
cockle-shell like that — well, to be frank, sir, it wants doing.”

I left Captain Goyles with the assurance that he would watch 
the weather as a mother would her sleeping babe; it was his 
own  simile,  and  it  struck  me  as  rather  touching.  I  saw  him 
again at twelve o’clock; he was watching it from the window of 
the “Chain and Anchor.”

At five o’clock that evening a stroke of luck occurred; in the 
middle of the High Street I met a couple of yachting friends, 
who had had to put in by reason of a strained rudder. I told 
them my story, and they appeared less surprised than amused. 
Captain  Goyles  and  the  two  men  were  still  watching  the 
weather. I ran into the “King’s Head,” and prepared Ethelber-
tha. The four of us crept quietly down to the quay, where we 
found our boat. Only the boy was on board; my two friends 
took charge of the yacht, and by six o’clock we were scudding 
merrily up the coast.

We  put  in  that  night  at  Aldborough,  and  the  next  day 
worked up to Yarmouth, where, as my friends had to leave, I 
decided to abandon the yacht. We sold the stores by auction 
on Yarmouth  sands  early  in  the  morning.  I  made  a  loss,  but 

— 212 —

had the satisfaction of “doing” Captain Goyles. I left the Rogue 
in charge of a local mariner, who, for a couple of sovereigns, 
undertook to see to its return to Harwich; and we came back 
to London by train. There may be yachts other than the Rogue, 
and  skippers  other  than  Mr.  Goyles,  but  that  experience  has 
prejudiced me against both.

George also thought a yacht would be a good deal of respon-

sibility, so we dismissed the idea.

“What about the river?” suggested Harris.
“We have had some pleasant times on that.”
George pulled in silence at his cigar, and I cracked another 

nut.

“The river is not what it used to be,” said I; “I don’t know 
what, but there’s a something — a dampness — about the river 
air that always starts my lumbago.”

“It’s the same with me,” said George. “I don’t know how it is, 
but I never can sleep now in the neighbourhood of the river. I 
spent a week at Joe’s place in the spring, and every night I woke 
up at seven o’clock and never got a wink afterwards.”

“I merely suggested it,” observed Harris. “Personally, I don’t 

think it good for me, either; it touches my gout.”

“What suits me best,” I said, “is mountain air. What say you 

to a walking tour in Scotland?”

“It’s always wet in Scotland,” said George. “I was three weeks 
in Scotland the year before last, and was never dry once all the 
time — not in that sense.”

“It’s fine enough in Switzerland,” said Harris.
“They would never stand our going to Switzerland by our-
selves,” I objected. “You know what happened last time. It must 
be some place where no delicately nurtured woman or child 
could  possibly  live;  a  country  of  bad  hotels  and  comfortless 
travelling;  where  we  shall  have  to  rough  it,  to  work  hard,  to 
starve perhaps —”

“Easy!”  interrupted  George, “easy,  there!  Don’t  forget  I’m 

coming with you.”

“I have it!” exclaimed Harris; “a bicycle tour!”

— 213 —

George looked doubtful.
“There’s a lot of uphill about a bicycle tour,” said he, “and the 

“So there is downhill, and the wind behind you,” said Har-

“I’ve never noticed it,” said George.
“You  won’t  think  of  anything  better  than  a  bicycle  tour,” 

I was inclined to agree with him.

wind is against you.”

“Why, that’s all uphill,” said George.
“Not all,” retorted Harris; “say two-thirds. And there’s one

The door opened, and Mrs. Harris appeared. She said that

waiting, had given “The Mad Hatter’s Tea Party” without us.

rose, and I passed it on to George as we went upstairs

I OPENED the ball with Ethelbertha that same evening. I com-
menced by being purposely a little irritable. My idea was that 
Ethelbertha  would  remark  upon  this.  I  should  admit  it,  and 
account  for  it  by  over  brain  pressure.  This  would  naturally 
lead to talk about my health in general, and the evident neces-
sity there was for my taking prompt and vigorous measures. I 
thought that with a little tact I might even manage so that the 
suggestion should come from Ethelbertha herself. I imagined 
her saying: “No, dear, it is change you want; complete change. 
Now be persuaded by me, and go away for a month. No, do 
not ask me to come with you. I know you would rather that 
I did, but I will not. It is the society of other men you need. 
Try and persuade George and Harris to go with you. Believe 
me, a highly strung brain such as yours demands occasional 
relaxation  from  the  strain  of  domestic  surroundings.  Forget 
for a little while that children want music lessons, and boots, 
and bicycles, with tincture of rhubarb three times a day; forget 
there  are  such  things  in  life  as  cooks,  and  house  decorators, 
and next-door dogs, and butchers’ bills. Go away to some green 
corner of the earth, where all is new and strange to you, where 
your over-wrought mind will gather peace and fresh ideas. Go 
away for a space and give me time to miss you, and to reflect 
upon  your  goodness  and  virtue,  which,  continually  present 
with me, I may, human-like, be apt to forget, as one, through 
use, grows indifferent to the blessing of the sun and the beauty 
of the moon. Go away, and come back refreshed in mind and 

— 215 —

body, a brighter, better man — if that be possible — than when 
you went away.”

But even when we obtain our desires they never come to us 
garbed as we would wish. To begin with, Ethelbertha did not 
seem to remark that I was irritable; I had to draw her attention 
to it. I said:

“You  must  forgive  me,  I’m  not  feeling  quite  myself  to-

night.”

weeks.”

She said: “Oh! I have not noticed anything different; what’s 

the matter with you?”

“I can’t tell you what it is,” I said; “I’ve felt it coming on for 

“It’s that whisky,” said Ethelbertha. “You never touch it ex-
cept when we go to the Harris’s. You know you can’t stand it; 
you have not a strong head.”

“It isn’t the whisky,” I replied; “it’s deeper than that. I fancy 

it’s more mental than bodily.”

“You’ve been reading those criticisms again,” said Ethelber-
tha, more sympathetically; “why don’t you take my advice and 
put them on the fire?”

“And it isn’t the criticisms,” I answered; “they’ve been quite 

flattering of late — one or two of them.”

“Well, what is it?” said Ethelbertha; “there must be some-

thing to account for it.”

“No, there isn’t,” I replied; “that’s the remarkable thing about 
it;  I  can  only  describe  it  as  a  strange  feeling  of  unrest  that 
seems to have taken possession of me.”

Ethelbertha glanced across at me with a somewhat curious 
expression, I thought; but as she said nothing, I continued the 
argument myself.

“This aching monotony of life, these days of peaceful, un-

eventful felicity, they appal one.”

“I should not grumble at them,” said Ethelbertha; “we might 

get some of the other sort, and like them still less.”

“I’m not so sure of that,” I replied. “In a life of continuous 
joy, I can imagine even pain coming as a welcome variation. 

— 216 —

I wonder sometimes whether the saints in heaven do not oc-
casionally feel the continual serenity a burden. To myself a life 
of  endless  bliss,  uninterrupted  by  a  single  contrasting  note, 
would, I feel, grow maddening. I suppose,” I continued, “I am a 
strange sort of man; I can hardly understand myself at times. 
There are moments,” I added, “when I hate myself.”

Often a little speech like this, hinting at hidden depths of in-
describable emotion has touched Ethelbertha, but to-night she 
appeared strangely unsympathetic. With regard to heaven and 
its  possible  effect  upon  me,  she  suggested  my  not  worrying 
myself about that, remarking it was always foolish to go half-
way  to  meet  trouble  that  might  never  come;  while  as  to  my 
being a strange sort of fellow, that, she supposed, I could not 
help, and if other people were willing to put up with me, there 
was an end of the matter. The monotony of life, she added, was 
a common experience; there she could sympathise with me.

“You don’t know I long,” said Ethelbertha, “to get away oc-
casionally, even from you; but I know it can never be, so I do 
not brood upon it.”

I had never heard Ethelbertha speak like this before; it as-

tonished and grieved me beyond measure.

“That’s not a very kind remark to make,” I said, “not a wifely 

remark.”

“I know it isn’t,” she replied; “that is why I have never said 
it before. You men never can understand,” continued Ethelber-
tha, “that, however fond a woman may be of a man, there are 
times when he palls upon her. You don’t know how I long to be 
able sometimes to put on my bonnet and go out, with nobody 
to ask me where I am going, why I am going, how long I am 
going to be, and when I shall be back. You don’t know how I 
sometimes long to order a dinner that I should like and that 
the children would like, but at the sight of which you would put 
on your hat and be off to the Club. You don’t know how much I 
feel inclined sometimes to invite some woman here that I like, 
and that I know you don’t; to go and see the people that I want 
to see, to go to bed when I am tired, and to get up when I feel 

— 217 —

I want to get up. Two people living together are bound both to 
be continually sacrificing their own desires to the other one. It 
is sometimes a good thing to slacken the strain a bit.”

On thinking over Ethelbertha’s words afterwards, have come 
to see their wisdom; but at the time I admit I was hurt and 
indignant.

“If your desire,” I said, “is to get rid of me —”
“Now, don’t be an old goose,” said Ethelbertha; “I only want 
to get rid of you for a little while, just long enough to forget 
there are one or two corners about you that are not perfect, just 
long enough to let me remember what a dear fellow you are in 
other respects, and to look forward to your return, as I used to 
look forward to your coming in the old days when I did not see 
you so often as to become, perhaps, a little indifferent to you, 
as one grows indifferent to the glory of the sun, just because 
he is there every day.”

I did not like the tone that Ethelbertha took. There seemed 
to be a frivolity about her, unsuited to the theme into which we 
had drifted. That a woman should contemplate cheerfully an 
absence of three or four weeks from her husband appeared to 
me to be not altogether nice, not what I call womanly; it was 
not like Ethelbertha at all. I was worried, I felt I didn’t want 
to go this trip at all. If it had not been for George and Harris, 
I would have abandoned it. As it was, I could not see how to 
change my mind with dignity.

“Very well, Ethelbertha,” I replied, “it shall be as you wish. If 
you desire a holiday from my presence, you shall enjoy it; but 
if it be not impertinent curiosity on the part of a husband, I 
should like to know what you propose doing in my absence?”
“We will take that house at Folkestone,” answered Ethelber-
tha, “and I’ll go down there with Kate. And if you want to do 
Clara Harris a good turn,” added Ethelbertha, “you’ll persuade 
Harris to go with you, and then Clara can join us. We three 
used to have some very jolly times together before you men 
ever came along, and it would be just delightful to renew them. 

— 218 —

Do  you  think,”  continued  Ethelbertha, “that  you  could  per-
suade Mr. Harris to go with you?”

I said I would try.
“There’s a dear boy,” said Ethelbertha; “try hard. You might 

get George to join you.”

I replied there was not much advantage in George’s coming, 
seeing  he  was  a  bachelor,  and  that  therefore  nobody  would 
be  much  benefited  by  his  absence.  But  a  woman  never  un-
derstands  satire.  Ethelbertha  merely  remarked  it  would  look 
unkind leaving him behind. I promised to put it to him.

I  met  Harris  at  the  Club  in  the  afternoon,  and  asked  him 

how he had got on.

ting away.”

He said, “Oh, that’s all right; there’s no difficulty about get-

But there was that about his tone that suggested incomplete 

satisfaction, so I pressed him for further details.

“She was as sweet as milk about it,” he continued; “said it 
was an excellent idea of George’s, and that she thought it would 
do me good.”

“That seems all right,” I said; “what’s wrong about that?”
“There’s nothing wrong about that,” he answered, “but that 

wasn’t all. She went on to talk of other things.”

“I understand,” I said.
“There’s that bathroom fad of hers,” he continued.
“I’ve heard of it,” I said; “she has started Ethelbertha on the 

same idea.”

“Well, I’ve had to agree to that being put in hand at once; I 
couldn’t argue any more when she was so nice about the other 
thing. That will cost me a hundred pounds, at the very least.”

“As much as that?” I asked.
“Every  penny  of  it,”  said  Harris;  “the  estimate  alone  is 

sixty.”

I was sorry to hear him say this.
“Then there’s the kitchen stove,” continued Harris; “every-
thing that has gone wrong in the house for the last two years 
has been the fault of that kitchen stove.”

— 219 —

“I  know,”  I  said. “We  have  been  in  seven  houses  since  we 
were married, and every kitchen stove has been worse than the 
last. Our present one is not only incompetent; it is spiteful. It 
knows when we are giving a party, and goes out of its way to 
do its worst.”

“We are going to have a new one,” said Harris, but he did not 
say it proudly. “Clara thought it would be such a saving of ex-
pense, having the two things done at the same time. I believe,” 
said Harris, “if a woman wanted a diamond tiara, she would 
explain that it was to save the expense of a bonnet.”

“How much do you reckon the stove is going to cost you?” I 

asked. I felt interested in the subject.

“I don’t know,” answered Harris; “another twenty, I suppose. 
Then we talked about the piano. Could you ever notice,” said 
Harris, “any difference between one piano and another?”

“Some of them seem to be a bit louder than others,” I an-

swered; “but one gets used to that.”

“Ours is all wrong about the treble,” said Harris. “By the way, 

what is the treble?”

“It’s the shrill end of the thing,” I explained; “the part that 
sounds as if you’d trod on its tail. The brilliant selections al-
ways end up with a flourish on it.”

“They want more of it,” said Harris; “our old one hasn’t got 
enough of it. I’ll have to put it in the nursery, and get a new one 
for the drawing-room.”

“Anything else?” I asked.
“No,” said Harris; “she didn’t seem able to think of anything 

“You’ll find when you get home,” I said, “she has thought of 

else.”

one other thing.”

“What’s that?” said Harris.
“A house at Folkestone for the season.”
“What  should  she  want  a  house  at  Folkestone  for?”  said 

Harris.

“To live in,” I suggested, “during the summer months.”

— 220 —

“She’s  going  to  her  people  in Wales,”  said  Harris, “for  the 

holidays, with the children; we’ve had an invitation.”

“Possibly,”  I  said,  “she’ll  go  to  Wales  before  she  goes  to 
Folkestone, or maybe she’ll take Wales on her way home; but 
she’ll want a house at Folkestone for the season, notwithstand-
ing. I may be mistaken — I hope for your sake that I am — but I 
feel a presentiment that I’m not.”

“This trip,” said Harris, “is going to be expensive.”
“It was an idiotic suggestion,” I said, “from the beginning.”
“It was foolish of us to listen to him,” said Harris; “he’ll get 

us into real trouble one of these days.”
“He always was a muddler,” I agreed.
“So headstrong,” added Harris.
We heard his voice at that moment in the hall, asking for 

letters.

to go back now.”

“Better not say anything to him,” I suggested; “it’s too late 

“There  would  be  no  advantage  in  doing  so,”  replied  Har-
ris. “I should have to get that bathroom and piano in any case 
now.”

He came in looking very cheerful.
“Well,” he said, “is it all right? Have you managed it?”
There  was  that  about  his  tone  I  did  not  altogether  like;  I 

noticed Harris resented it also.

“Managed what?” I said.
“Why, to get off,” said George.
I felt the time was come to explain things to George.
“In married life,” I said, “the man proposes, the woman sub-

mits. It is her duty; all religion teaches it.”

George folded his hands and fixed his eyes on the ceiling.
“We may chaff and joke a little about these things,” I con-
tinued; “but  when  it  comes  to  practice,  that  is  what  always 
happens. We have mentioned to our wives that we are going. 
Naturally, they are grieved; they would prefer to come with us; 
failing that, they would have us remain with them. But we have 

— 221 —

explained to them our wishes on the subject, and — there’s an 
end of the matter.”

George said, “Forgive me; I did not understand. I am only a 

bachelor. People tell me this, that, and the other, and I listen.”
I said, “That is where you do wrong. When you want infor-
mation  come  to  Harris  or  myself;  we  will  tell  you  the  truth 
about these questions.”

George thanked us, and we proceeded with the business in 

hand.

better.”

“When shall we start?” said George.
“So far as I am concerned,” replied Harris, “the sooner the 

His idea, I fancy, was to get away before Mrs. H. thought of 

other things. We fixed the following Wednesday.

“What about route?” said Harris.
“I have an idea,” said George. “I take it you fellows are natu-

rally anxious to improve your minds?”

I said, “We don’t want to become monstrosities. To a reason-
able degree, yes, if it can be done without much expense and 
with little personal trouble.”

“It  can,”  said  George. “We  know  Holland  and  the  Rhine. 
Very well, my suggestion is that we take the boat to Hamburg, 
see Berlin and Dresden, and work our way to the Schwarzwald, 
through Nuremberg and Stuttgart.”

“There  are  some  pretty  bits  in  Mesopotamia,  so  I’ve  been 

told,” murmured Harris.

George said Mesopotamia was too much out of our way, but 
that the Berlin-Dresden route was quite practicable. For good 
or evil, he persuaded us into it.

“The machines, I suppose,” said George, “as before. Harris 

and I on the tandem, J. —”

Harris —”

“I think not,” interrupted Harris, firmly. “You and J. on the 

“All the same to me,” agreed George. “J. and I on the tandem, 

“I  do  not  mind  taking  my  turn,”  I  interrupted, “but  I  am 

— 222 —

not going to carry George all the way; the burden should be 
divided.”

“Very well,” agreed Harris, “we’ll divide it. But it must be on 

the distinct understanding that he works.”

“That he what?” said George.
“That he works,” repeated Harris, firmly; “at all events, up-

hill.”

“Great Scott!” said George; “don’t you want any exercise?”
There is always unpleasantness about this tandem. It is the 
theory of the man in front that the man behind does nothing; 
it is equally the theory of the man behind that he alone is the 
motive power, the man in front merely doing the puffing. The 
mystery will never be solved. It is annoying when Prudence is 
whispering to you on the one side not to overdo your strength 
and bring on heart disease; while Justice into the other ear is 
remarking, “Why should you do it all? This isn’t a cab. He’s not 
your passenger:” to hear him grunt out:

“What’s the matter — lost your pedals?”
Harris,  in  his  early  married  days,  made  much  trouble  for 
himself on one occasion, owing to this impossibility of know-
ing what the person behind is doing. He was riding with his 
wife through Holland. The roads were stony, and the machine 
jumped a good deal.

“Sit tight,” said Harris, without turning his head.
What  Mrs.  Harris  thought  he  said  was,  “Jump  off.”  Why 
she should have thought he said “Jump off,” when he said “Sit 
tight,” neither of them can explain.

Mrs. Harris puts it in this way, “If you had said, ‘Sit tight,’ 

why should I have jumped off?”

Harris puts it, “If I had wanted you to jump off, why should 

I have said ‘Sit tight!’?”

this day.

The  bitterness  is  past,  but  they  argue  about  the  matter  to 

Be the explanation what it may, however, nothing alters the 
fact that Mrs. Harris did jump off, while Harris pedalled away 
hard, under the impression she was still behind him. It appears 

— 223 —

that  at  first  she  thought  he  was  riding  up  the  hill  merely  to 
show  off.  They  were  both  young  in  those  days,  and  he  used 
to do that sort of thing. She expected him to spring to earth 
on  reaching  the  summit,  and  lean  in  a  careless  and  graceful 
attitude  against  the  machine,  waiting  for  her. When,  on  the 
contrary,  she  saw  him  pass  the  summit  and  proceed  rapidly 
down a long and steep incline, she was seized, first with sur-
prise,  secondly  with  indignation,  and  lastly  with  alarm.  She 
ran to the top of the hill and shouted, but he never turned his 
head. She watched him disappear into a wood a mile and a half 
distant, and then sat down and cried. They had had a slight 
difference that morning, and she wondered if he had taken it 
seriously and intended desertion. She had no money; she knew 
no Dutch. People passed, and seemed sorry for her; she tried 
to make them understand what had happened. They gathered 
that she had lost something, but could not grasp what. They 
took her to the nearest village, and found a policeman for her. 
He concluded from her pantomime that some man had stolen 
her  bicycle.  They  put  the  telegraph  into  operation,  and  dis-
covered in a village four miles off an unfortunate boy riding 
a lady’s machine of an obsolete pattern. They brought him to 
her in a cart, but as she did not appear to want either him or 
his bicycle they let him go again, and resigned themselves to 
bewilderment.

Meanwhile, Harris continued his ride with much enjoyment. 
It seemed to him that he had suddenly become a stronger, and 
in every way a more capable cyclist. Said he to what he thought 
was Mrs. Harris:

“I haven’t felt this machine so light for months. It’s this air, I 

think; it’s doing me good.”

Then he told her not to be afraid, and he would show her 
how fast he could go. He bent down over the handles, and put 
his heart into his work. The bicycle bounded over the road like 
a  thing  of  life;  farmhouses  and  churches,  dogs  and  chickens 
came to him and passed. Old folks stood and gazed at him, the 
children cheered him.

— 224 —

In  this  way  he  sped  merrily  onward  for  about  five  miles. 
Then, as he explains it, the feeling began to grow upon him 
that something was wrong. He was not surprised at the silence; 
the wind was blowing strongly, and the machine was rattling 
a good deal. It was a sense of void that came upon him. He 
stretched out his hand behind him, and felt; there was noth-
ing there but space. He jumped, or rather fell off, and looked 
back up the road; it stretched white and straight through the 
dark wood, and not a living soul could be seen upon it. He re-
mounted, and rode back up the hill. In ten minutes he came to 
where the road broke into four; there he dismounted and tried 
to remember which fork he had come down.

While  he  was  deliberating  a  man  passed,  sitting  sideways 
on a horse. Harris stopped him, and explained to him that he 
had lost his wife. The man appeared to be neither surprised 
nor  sorry  for  him.  While  they  were  talking  another  farmer 
came along, to whom the first man explained the matter, not 
as an accident, but as a good story. What appeared to surprise 
the second man most was that Harris should be making a fuss 
about the thing. He could get no sense out of either of them, 
and cursing them he mounted his machine again, and took the 
middle road on chance. Half-way up, he came upon a party of 
two young women with one young man between them. They 
appeared to be making the most of him. He asked them if they 
had seen his wife. They asked him what she was like. He did 
not know enough Dutch to describe her properly; all he could 
tell them was she was a very beautiful woman, of medium size. 
Evidently  this  did  not  satisfy  them,  the  description  was  too 
general; any man could say that, and by this means perhaps 
get possession of a wife that did not belong to him. They asked 
him how she was dressed; for the life of him he could not rec-
ollect.

I doubt if any man could tell how any woman was dressed 
ten minutes after he had left her. He recollected a blue skirt, 
and then there was something that carried the dress on, as it 
were, up to the neck. Possibly, this may have been a blouse; he 

— 225 —

retained a dim vision of a belt; but what sort of a blouse? Was it 
green, or yellow, or blue? Had it a collar, or was it fastened with 
a bow? Were there feathers in her hat, or flowers? Or was it a 
hat at all? He dared not say, for fear of making a mistake and 
being sent miles after the wrong party. The two young women 
giggled, which in his then state of mind irritated Harris. The 
young man, who appeared anxious to get rid of him, suggested 
the police station at the next town. Harris made his way there. 
The police gave him a piece of paper, and told him to write 
down  a  full  description  of  his  wife,  together  with  details  of 
when and where he had lost her. He did not know where he 
had lost her; all he could tell them was the name of the village 
where he had lunched. He knew he had her with him then, and 
that they had started from there together.

The  police  looked  suspicious;  they  were  doubtful  about 
three matters: Firstly, was she really his wife? Secondly, had he 
really lost her? Thirdly, why had he lost her? With the aid of a 
hotel-keeper, however, who spoke a little English, he overcame 
their scruples. They promised to act, and in the evening they 
brought her to him in a covered wagon, together with a bill for 
expenses. The meeting was not a tender one. Mrs. Harris is not 
a good actress, and always has great difficulty in disguising her 
feelings. On this occasion, she frankly admits, she made no at-
tempt to disguise them.

The wheel business settled, there arose the ever-lasting lug-

gage question.

“The usual list, I suppose,” said George, preparing to write.
That was wisdom I had taught them; I had learned it myself 

years ago from my Uncle Podger.

“Always  before  beginning  to  pack,”  my  Uncle  would  say, 

“make a list.”

He was a methodical man.
“Take  a  piece  of  paper” — he  always  began  at  the  begin-
ning — “put down on it everything you can possibly require, 
then go over it and see that it contains nothing you can pos-
sibly do without. Imagine yourself in bed; what have you got 

— 226 —

on? Very well, put it down — together with a change. You get 
up; what do you do? Wash yourself. What do you wash your-
self with? Soap; put down soap. Go on till you have finished. 
Then take your clothes. Begin at your feet; what do you wear 
on your feet? Boots, shoes, socks; put them down. Work up till 
you get to your head. What else do you want besides clothes? A 
little brandy; put it down. A corkscrew, put it down. Put down 
everything, then you don’t forget anything.”

That is the plan he always pursued himself. The list made, 
he would go over it carefully, as he always advised, to see that 
he had forgotten nothing. Then he would go over it again, and 
strike out everything it was possible to dispense with.

Then he would lose the list.
Said George: “Just sufficient for a day or two we will take 
with us on our bikes. The bulk of our luggage we must send on 
from town to town.”

“We must be careful,” I said; “I knew a man once —”
Harris looked at his watch.
“We’ll hear about him on the boat,” said Harris; “I have got 

to meet Clara at Waterloo Station in half an hour.”

“It won’t take half an hour,” I said; “it’s a true story, and —”
“Don’t waste it,” said George: “I am told there are rainy eve-
nings in the Black Forest; we may he glad of it. What we have 
to do now is to finish this list.”

Now  I  come  to  think  of  it,  I  never  did  get  off  that  story; 

something always interrupted it. And it really was true.

CHAPTER III

Harris’s  one  fault — Harris  and  the  Angel — A  patent  bicycle 
lamp — The  ideal  saddle — The “Overhauler” — His  eagle  eye — 
His method — His cheery confidence — His simple and inexpensive 
tastes — His  appearance — How  to  get  rid  of  him — George  as 
prophet — The gentle art of making oneself disagreeable in a for-
eign tongue — George as a student of human nature — He proposes 
an  experiment — His  Prudence — Harris’s  support  secured,  upon 

conditions.

ON Monday afternoon Harris came round; he had a cycling 
paper in his hand.

I said: “If you take my advice, you will leave it alone.”
Harris said: “Leave what alone?”
I  said:  “That  brand-new,  patent,  revolution  in  cycling, 
record-breaking, Tomfoolishness, whatever it may be, the ad-
vertisement of which you have there in your hand.”

He said: “Well, I don’t know; there will be some steep hills 

for us to negotiate; I guess we shall want a good brake.”

I  said: “We  shall  want  a  brake,  I  agree;  what  we  shall  not 
want is a mechanical surprise that we don’t understand, and 
that never acts when it is wanted.”

“This thing,” he said, “acts automatically.”
“You needn’t tell me,” I said. “I know exactly what it will do, 
by instinct. Going uphill it will jamb the wheel so effectively 
that we shall have to carry the machine bodily. The air at the 
top of the hill will do it good, and it will suddenly come right 
again. Going downhill it will start reflecting what a nuisance 
it has been. This will lead to remorse, and finally to despair. 
It will say to itself: ‘I’m not fit to be a brake. I don’t help these 
fellows; I only hinder them. I’m a curse, that’s what I am;’ and, 
without a word of warning, it will ‘chuck’ the whole business. 
That is what that brake will do. Leave it alone. You are a good 
fellow,” I continued, “but you have one fault.”

“What?” he asked, indignantly.
“You have too much faith,” I answered. “If you read an ad-
vertisement, you go away and believe it. Every experiment that 

— 228 —

every fool has thought of in connection with cycling you have 
tried. Your guardian angel appears to be a capable and consci-
entious spirit, and hitherto she has seen you through; take my 
advice and don’t try her too far. She must have had a busy time 
since you started cycling. Don’t go on till you make her mad.”
He said: “If every man talked like that there would be no 
advancement made in any department of life. If nobody ever 
tried a new thing the world would come to a standstill. It is 
by —”

“I know all that can be said on that side of the argument,” I 
interrupted. “I agree in trying new experiments up to thirty-
five; after thirty-five I consider a man is entitled to think of 
himself. You and I have done our duty in this direction, you 
especially. You have been blown up by a patent gas lamp —”

He said: “I really think, you know, that was my fault; I think 

I must have screwed it up too tight.”

I said: “I am quite willing to believe that if there was a wrong 
way of handling the thing that is the way you handle it. You 
should take that tendency of yours into consideration; it bears 
upon the argument. Myself, I did not notice what you did; I 
only know we were riding peacefully and pleasantly along the 
Whitby  Road,  discussing  the  Thirty  Years’  War,  when  your 
lamp  went  off  like  a  pistol-shot.  The  start  sent  me  into  the 
ditch;  and  your  wife’s  face,  when  I  told  her  there  was  noth-
ing the matter and that she was not to worry, because the two 
men would carry you upstairs, and the doctor would be round 
in  a  minute  bringing  the  nurse  with  him,  still  lingers  in  my 
memory.”

He  said: “I  wish  you  had  thought  to  pick  up  the  lamp.  I 
should like to have found out what was the cause of its going 
off like that.”

I said: “There was not time to pick up the lamp. I calculate it 
would have taken two hours to have collected it. As to its ‘going 
off,’ the mere fact of its being advertised as the safest lamp ever 
invented would of itself, to anyone but you, have suggested ac-
cident. Then there was that electric lamp,” I continued.

— 229 —

“Well, that really did give a fine light,” he replied; “you said 

so yourself.”

I said: “It gave a brilliant light in the King’s Road, Brighton, 
and frightened a horse. The moment we got into the dark be-
yond  Kemp  Town  it  went  out,  and  you  were  summoned  for 
riding without a light. You may remember that on sunny after-
noons you used to ride about with that lamp shining for all it 
was worth. When lighting-up time came it was naturally tired, 
and wanted a rest.”

“It was a bit irritating, that lamp,” he murmured; “I remem-

ber it.”

I  said: “It  irritated  me;  it  must  have  been  worse  for  you. 
Then there are saddles,” I went on — I wished to get this lesson 
home  to  him. “Can  you  think  of  any  saddle  ever  advertised 
that you have not tried?”

He said: “It has been an idea of mine that the right saddle is 

to be found.”

I said: “You give up that idea; this is an imperfect world of 
joy  and  sorrow  mingled.  There  may  be  a  better  land  where 
bicycle saddles are made out of rainbow, stuffed with cloud; 
in  this  world  the  simplest  thing  is  to  get  used  to  something 
hard. There was that saddle you bought in Birmingham; it was 
divided in the middle, and looked like a pair of kidneys.”

He  said: “You  mean  that  one  constructed  on  anatomical 

principles.”

“Very likely,” I replied. “The box you bought it in had a pic-
ture  on  the  cover,  representing  a  sitting  skeleton — or  rather 
that part of a skeleton which does sit.”

He said: “It was quite correct; it showed you the true posi-

tion of the —”

seemed to me indelicate.”

I  said:  “We  will  not  go  into  details;  the  picture  always 

He said: “Medically speaking, it was right.”
“Possibly,” I said, “for a man who rode in nothing but his 
bones. I only know that I tried it myself, and that to a man who 
wore flesh it was agony. Every time you went over a stone or a 

— 230 —

rut it nipped you; it was like riding on an irritable lobster. You 
rode that for a month.”

“I thought it only right to give it a fair trial,” he answered.
I said: “You gave your family a fair trial also; if you will al-
low me the use of slang. Your wife told me that never in the 
whole course of your married life had she known you so bad 
tempered, so un-Christian like, as you were that month. Then 
you remember that other saddle, the one with the spring under 
it.”

He said: “You mean ‘the Spiral.’”
I said: “I mean the one that jerked you up and down like 
a  Jack-in-the-box;  sometimes  you  came  down  again  in  the 
right  place,  and  sometimes  you  didn’t.  I  am  not  referring  to 
these matters merely to recall painful memories, but I want to 
impress you with the folly of trying experiments at your time 
of life.”

He said. “I wish you wouldn’t harp so much on my age. A 

man at thirty-four —”

“A man at what?”
He said: “If you don’t want the thing, don’t have it. If your 
machine runs away with you down a mountain, and you and 
George get flung through a church roof, don’t blame me.”

“I  cannot  promise  for  George,”  I  said; “a  little  thing  will 
sometimes  irritate  him,  as  you  know.  If  such  an  accident  as 
you suggest happen, he may be cross, but I will undertake to 
explain to him that it was not your fault.”

“Is the thing all right?” he asked.
“The tandem,” I replied, “is well.”
He said: “Have you overhauled it?”
I said: “I have not, nor is anyone else going to overhaul it. 
The thing is now in working order, and it is going to remain in 
working order till we start.”

I  have  had  experience  of  this “overhauling.”  There  was  a 
man at Folkestone; I used to meet him on the Lees. He pro-
posed  one  evening  we  should  go  for  a  long  bicycle  ride  to-
gether on the following day, and I agreed. I got up early, for me; 

— 231 —

I made an effort, and was pleased with myself. He came half an 
hour late: I was waiting for him in the garden. It was a lovely 
day. He said: —

“That’s  a  good-looking  machine  of  yours.  How  does  it 

run?”

“Oh, like most of them!” I answered; “easily enough in the 

morning; goes a little stiffly after lunch.”

He  caught  hold  of  it  by  the  front  wheel  and  the  fork  and 

shook it violently.

I said: “Don’t do that; you’ll hurt it.”
I did not see why he should shake it; it had not done any-
thing to him. Besides, if it wanted shaking, I was the proper 
person  to  shake  it.  I  felt  much  as  I  should  had  he  started 
whacking my dog.

He said: “This front wheel wobbles.”
I said: “It doesn’t if you don’t wobble it.” It didn’t wobble, as 

a matter of fact — nothing worth calling a wobble.

He  said: “This  is  dangerous;  have  you  got  a  screw-ham-

mer?”

I  ought  to  have  been  firm,  but  I  thought  that  perhaps  he 
really did know something about the business. I went to the 
tool shed to see what I could find. When I came back he was 
sitting on the ground with the front wheel between his legs. He 
was playing with it, twiddling it round between his fingers; the 
remnant of the machine was lying on the gravel path beside 
him.

He  said: “Something  has  happened  to  this  front  wheel  of 

yours.”

“It looks like it, doesn’t it?” I answered. But he was the sort 

of man that never understands satire.

He said: “It looks to me as if the bearings were all wrong.”
I said: “Don’t you trouble about it any more; you will make 

yourself tired. Let us put it back and get off.”

He said: “We may as well see what is the matter with it, now 
it is out.” He talked as though it had dropped out by accident.
Before I could stop him he had unscrewed something some-

— 232 —

where, and out rolled all over the path some dozen or so little 
balls.

“Catch ’em!” he shouted; “catch ’em! We mustn’t lose any of 

them.” He was quite excited about them.

We grovelled round for half an hour, and found sixteen. He 
said he hoped we had got them all, because, if not, it would 
make a serious difference to the machine. He said there was 
nothing you should be more careful about in taking a bicycle 
to pieces than seeing you did not lose any of the balls. He ex-
plained that you ought to count them as you took them out, 
and see that exactly the same number went back in each place. 
I promised, if ever I took a bicycle to pieces I would remember 
his advice.

I put the balls for safety in my hat, and I put my hat upon 
the doorstep. It was not a sensible thing to do, I admit. As a 
matter of fact, it was a silly thing to do. I am not as a rule ad-
dle-headed; his influence must have affected me.

He then said that while he was about it he would see to the 
chain for me, and at once began taking off the gear-case. I did 
try to persuade him from that. I told him what an experienced 
friend of mine once said to me solemnly: —

“If anything goes wrong with your gear-case, sell the ma-

chine and buy a new one; it comes cheaper.”

He  said:  “People  talk  like  that  who  understand  nothing 
about  machines.  Nothing  is  easier  than  taking  off  a  gear-
case.”

I had to confess he was right. In less than five minutes he 
had  the  gear-case  in  two  pieces,  lying  on  the  path,  and  was 
grovelling for screws. He said it was always a mystery to him 
the way screws disappeared.

We  were  still  looking  for  the  screws  when  Ethelbertha 
came out. She seemed surprised to find us there; she said she 
thought we had started hours ago.

He said: “We shan’t be long now. I’m just helping your hus-
band to overhaul this machine of his. It’s a good machine; but 
they all want going over occasionally.”

— 233 —

Ethelbertha said: “If you want to wash yourselves when you 
have  done  you  might  go  into  the  back  kitchen,  if  you  don’t 
mind; the girls have just finished the bedrooms.”

She  told  me  that  if  she  met  Kate  they  would  probably  go 
for a sail; but that in any case she would be back to lunch. I 
would have given a sovereign to be going with her. I was get-
ting heartily sick of standing about watching this fool breaking 
up my bicycle.

Common  sense  continued  to  whisper  to  me:  “Stop  him, 
before he does any more mischief. You have a right to protect 
your own property from the ravages of a lunatic. Take him by 
the scruff of the neck, and kick him out of the gate!”

But I am weak when it comes to hurting other people’s feel-

ings, and I let him muddle on.

He gave up looking for the rest of the screws. He said screws 
had a knack of turning up when you least expected them; and 
that now he would see to the chain. He tightened it till it would 
not move; next he loosened it until it was twice as loose as it 
was before. Then he said we had better think about getting the 
front wheel back into its place again.

I held the fork open, and he worried with the wheel. At the 
end of ten minutes I suggested he should hold the forks, and 
that I should handle the wheel; and we changed places. At the 
end of his first minute he dropped the machine, and took a 
short  walk  round  the  croquet  lawn,  with  his  hands  pressed 
together between his thighs. He explained as he walked that 
the  thing  to  be  careful  about  was  to  avoid  getting  your  fin-
gers pinched between the forks and the spokes of the wheel. I 
replied I was convinced, from my own experience, that there 
was much truth in what he said. He wrapped himself up in a 
couple of dusters, and we commenced again. At length we did 
get the thing into position; and the moment it was in position 
he burst out laughing.

I said: “What’s the joke?”
He said: “Well, I am an ass!”

— 234 —

It was the first thing he had said that made me respect him. 

I asked him what had led him to the discovery.

He said: “We’ve forgotten the balls!”
I looked for my hat; it was lying topsy-turvy in the middle 
of the path, and Ethelbertha’s favourite hound was swallowing 
the balls as fast as he could pick them up.

“He will kill himself,” said Ebbson — I have never met him 
since that day, thank the Lord; but I think his name was Ebb-
son — “they are solid steel.”

I said: “I am not troubling about the dog. He has had a boot-
lace and a packet of needles already this week. Nature’s the best 
guide; puppies seem to require this kind of stimulant. What I 
am thinking about is my bicycle.”

He was of a cheerful disposition. He said: “Well, we must put 

back all we can find, and trust to Providence.”

We found eleven. We fixed six on one side and five on the 
other, and half an hour later the wheel was in its place again. 
It need hardly be added that it really did wobble now; a child 
might have noticed it. Ebbson said it would do for the present. 
He appeared to be getting a bit tired himself. If I had let him, 
he would, I believe, at this point have gone home. I was de-
termined now, however, that he should stop and finish; I had 
abandoned all thoughts of a ride. My pride in the machine he 
had killed. My only interest lay now in seeing him scratch and 
bump and pinch himself. I revived his drooping spirits with a 
glass of beer and some judicious praise. I said:

“Watching  you  do  this  is  of  real  use  to  me.  It  is  not  only 
your  skill  and  dexterity  that  fascinates  me,  it  is  your  cheery 
confidence  in  yourself,  your  inexplicable  hopefulness,  that 
does me good.”

Thus encouraged, he set to work to refix the gear-case. He 
stood the bicycle against the house, and worked from the off 
side. Then he stood it against a tree, and worked from the near 
side. Then I held it for him, while he lay on the ground with 
his head between the wheels, and worked at it from below, and 
dropped oil upon himself. Then he took it away from me, and 

— 235 —

doubled himself across it like a pack-saddle, till he lost his bal-
ance and slid over on to his head. Three times he said:

“Thank Heaven, that’s right at last!”
And twice he said:
“No, I’m damned if it is after all!”
What he said the third time I try to forget.
Then he lost his temper and tried bullying the thing. The bi-
cycle, I was glad to see, showed spirit; and the subsequent pro-
ceedings degenerated into little else than a rough-and-tumble 
fight between him and the machine. One moment the bicycle 
would be on the gravel path, and he on top of it; the next, the 
position would be reversed — he on the gravel path, the bicycle 
on him. Now he would be standing flushed with victory, the 
bicycle firmly fixed between his legs. But his triumph would be 
short-lived. By a sudden, quick movement it would free itself, 
and, turning upon him, hit him sharply over the head with one 
of its handles.

At a quarter to one, dirty and dishevelled, cut and breeding, 

he said: “I think that will do;” and rose and wiped his brow.

The bicycle looked as if it also had had enough of it. Which 
had received most punishment it would have been difficult to 
say. I took him into the back kitchen, where, so far as was pos-
sible without soda and proper tools, he cleaned himself, and 
sent him home.

The bicycle I put into a cab and took round to the nearest 
repairing shop. The foreman of the works came up and looked 
at it.

“What do you want me to do with that?” said he.
“I want you,” I said, “so far as is possible, to restore it.”
“It’s a bit far gone,” said he; “but I’ll do my best.”
He did his best, which came to two pounds ten. But it was 
never the same machine again; and at the end of the season I 
left it in an agent’s hands to sell. I wished to deceive nobody; I 
instructed the man to advertise it as a last year’s machine. The 
agent advised me not to mention any date. He said:

“In this business it isn’t a question of what is true and what 

— 236 —

isn’t; it’s a question of what you can get people to believe. Now, 
between you and me, it don’t look like a last year’s machine; so 
far as looks are concerned, it might be a ten-year old. We’ll say 
nothing about date; we’ll just get what we can.”

I left the matter to him, and he got me five pounds, which he 

said was more than he had expected.

There are two ways you can get exercise out of a bicycle: you 
can “overhaul” it, or you can ride it. On the whole, I am not 
sure that a man who takes his pleasure overhauling does not 
have the best of the bargain. He is independent of the weather 
and the wind; the state of the roads troubles him not. Give him 
a screw-hammer, a bundle of rags, an oil-can, and something 
to sit down upon, and he is happy for the day. He has to put up 
with certain disadvantages, of course; there is no joy without 
alloy. He himself always looks like a tinker, and his machine 
always suggests the idea that, having stolen it, he has tried to 
disguise it; but as he rarely gets beyond the first milestone with 
it, this, perhaps, does not much matter. The mistake some peo-
ple make is in thinking they can get both forms of sport out of 
the same machine. This is impossible; no machine will stand 
the double strain. You must make up your mind whether you 
are going to be an “overhauler” or a rider. Personally, I prefer 
to ride, therefore I take care to have near me nothing that can 
tempt me to overhaul. When anything happens to my machine 
I wheel it to the nearest repairing shop. If I am too far from 
the town or village to walk, I sit by the roadside and wait till 
a cart comes along. My chief danger, I always find, is from the 
wandering  overhauler.  The  sight  of  a  broken-down  machine 
is to the overhauler as a wayside corpse to a crow; he swoops 
down upon it with a friendly yell of triumph. At first I used to 
try politeness. I would say:

“It  is  nothing;  don’t  you  trouble.  You  ride  on,  and  enjoy 

yourself, I beg it of you as a favour; please go away.”

Experience has taught me, however, that courtesy is of no 

use in such an extremity. Now I say:

— 237 —

“You go away and leave the thing alone, or I will knock your 

silly head off.”

And if you look determined, and have a good stout cudgel in 

your hand, you can generally drive him off.
George came in later in the day. He said:
“Well, do you think everything will be ready?”
I said: “Everything will be ready by Wednesday, except, per-

haps, you and Harris.”

He said: “Is the tandem all right?”
“The tandem,” I said, “is well.”
He said: “You don’t think it wants overhauling?”
I replied: “Age and experience have taught me that there are 
few matters concerning which a man does well to be positive. 
Consequently, there remain to me now but a limited number 
of questions upon which I feel any degree of certainty. Among 
such still-unshaken beliefs, however, is the conviction that that 
tandem does not want overhauling. I also feel a presentiment 
that, provided my life is spared, no human being between now 
and Wednesday morning is going to overhaul it.”

George said: “I should not show temper over the matter, if I 
were you. There will come a day, perhaps not far distant, when 
that  bicycle,  with  a  couple  of  mountains  between  it  and  the 
nearest repairing shop, will, in spite of your chronic desire for 
rest, have to be overhauled. Then you will clamour for people 
to tell you where you put the oil-can, and what you have done 
with the screw-hammer. Then, while you exert yourself hold-
ing the thing steady against a tree, you will suggest that some-
body else should clean the chain and pump the back wheel.”

I  felt  there  was  justice  in  George’s  rebuke — also  a  certain 

amount of prophetic wisdom. I said:

“Forgive me if I seemed unresponsive. The truth is, Harris 

was round here this morning —”

George  said: “Say  no  more;  I  understand.  Besides,  what  I 

came to talk to you about was another matter. Look at that.”

He  handed  me  a  small  book  bound  in  red  cloth.  It  was  a 
guide to English conversation for the use of German travel-

— 238 —

lers. It commenced “On a Steam-boat,” and terminated “At the 
Doctor’s”;  its  longest  chapter  being  devoted  to  conversation 
in a railway carriage, among, apparently, a compartment load 
of  quarrelsome  and  ill-mannered  lunatics: “Can  you  not  get 
further away from me, sir?” — “It is impossible, madam; my 
neighbour, here, is very stout” — “Shall we not endeavour to 
arrange our legs?” — “Please have the goodness to keep your 
elbows down” — “Pray do not inconvenience yourself, madam, 
if  my  shoulder  is  of  any  accommodation  to  you,”  whether 
intended to be said sarcastically or not, there was nothing to 
indicate — “I really must request you to move a little, madam, 
I can hardly breathe,” the author’s idea being, presumably, that 
by  this  time  the  whole  party  was  mixed  up  together  on  the 
floor.  The  chapter  concluded  with  the  phrase, “Here  we  are 
at our destination, God be thanked! (Gott sei dank!)” a pious 
exclamation, which under the circumstances must have taken 
the form of a chorus.

At the end of the book was an appendix, giving the German 
traveller hints concerning the preservation of his health and 
comfort  during  his  sojourn  in  English  towns,  chief  among 
such hints being advice to him to always travel with a supply of 
disinfectant powder, to always lock his bedroom door at night, 
and to always carefully count his small change.

“It is not a brilliant publication,” I remarked, handing the 
book back to George; “it is not a book that personally I would 
recommend to any German about to visit England; I think it 
would  get  him  disliked.  But  I  have  read  books  published  in 
London for the use of English travellers abroad every whit as 
foolish.  Some  educated  idiot,  misunderstanding  seven  lan-
guages, would appear to go about writing these books for the 
misinformation and false guidance of modern Europe.”

“You  cannot  deny,”  said  George, “that  these  books  are  in 
large  request.  They  are  bought  by  the  thousand,  I  know.  In 
every town in Europe there must be people going about talk-
ing this sort of thing.”

“Maybe,”  I  replied;  “but  fortunately  nobody  understands 

— 239 —

them.  I  have  noticed,  myself,  men  standing  on  railway  plat-
forms  and  at  street  corners  reading  aloud  from  such  books. 
Nobody knows what language they are speaking; nobody has 
the slightest knowledge of what they are saying. This is, per-
haps, as well; were they understood they would probably be 
assaulted.”

George said: “Maybe you are right; my idea is to see what 
would happen if they were understood. My proposal is to get 
to London early on Wednesday morning, and spend an hour or 
two going about and shopping with the aid of this book. There 
are one or two little things I want — a hat and a pair of bed-
room slippers, among other articles. Our boat does not leave 
Tilbury till twelve, and that just gives us time. I want to try this 
sort of talk where I can properly judge of its effect. I want to 
see how the foreigner feels when he is talked to in this way.”

It struck me as a sporting idea. In my enthusiasm I offered 
to accompany him, and wait outside the shop. I said I thought 
that Harris would like to be in it, too — or rather outside.

George said that was not quite his scheme. His proposal was 
that Harris and I should accompany him into the shop. With 
Harris, who looks formidable, to support him, and myself at 
the door to call the police if necessary, he said he was willing 
to adventure the thing.

We walked round to Harris’s, and put the proposal before 
him.  He  examined  the  book,  especially  the  chapters  dealing 
with the purchase of shoes and hats. He said:

“If George talks to any bootmaker or any hatter the things 
that are put down here, it is not support he will want; it is car-
rying to the hospital that he will need.”

That made George angry.
“You talk,” said George, “as though I were a foolhardy boy 
without any sense. I shall select from the more polite and less 
irritating speeches; the grosser insults I shall avoid.”

This being clearly understood, Harris gave in his adhesion; 

and our start was fixed for early Wednesday morning.

We arrive in London — We talk the language of the traveller.

GEORGE came down on Tuesday evening, and slept at Harris’s 
place. We thought this a better arrangement than his own sug-
gestion, which was that we should call for him on our way and 
“pick him up.” Picking George up in the morning means pick-
ing him out of bed to begin with, and shaking him awake — in 
itself an exhausting effort with which to commence the day; 
helping him find his things and finish his packing; and then 
waiting  for  him  while  he  eats  his  breakfast,  a  tedious  enter-
tainment from the spectator’s point of view, full of wearisome 
repetition.

I knew that if he slept at “Beggarbush” he would be up in 
time;  I  have  slept  there  myself,  and  I  know  what  happens. 
About the middle of the night, as you judge, though in reality it 
may be somewhat later, you are startled out of your first sleep 
by what sounds like a rush of cavalry along the passage, just 
outside your door. Your half-awakened intelligence fluctuates 
between burglars, the Day of Judgment, and a gas explosion. 
You  sit  up  in  bed  and  listen  intently. You  are  not  kept  wait-
ing long; the next moment a door is violently slammed, and 
somebody,  or  something,  is  evidently  coming  downstairs  on 
a tea-tray.

“I told you so,” says a voice outside, and immediately some 
hard substance, a head one would say from the ring of it, re-
bounds against the panel of your door.

By  this  time  you  are  charging  madly  round  the  room  for 
your clothes. Nothing is where you put it overnight, the articles 
most essential have disappeared entirely; and meanwhile the 

— 241 —

murder, or revolution, or whatever it is, continues unchecked. 
You pause for a moment, with your head under the wardrobe, 
where you think you can see your slippers, to listen to a steady, 
monotonous thumping upon a distant door. The victim, you 
presume, has taken refuge there; they mean to have him out 
and  finish  him.  Will  you  be  in  time?  The  knocking  ceases, 
and a voice, sweetly reassuring in its gentle plaintiveness, asks 
meekly:

“Pa, may I get up?”
You do not hear the other voice, but the responses are:
“No, it was only the bath — no, she ain’t really hurt, — only 
wet, you know. Yes, ma, I’ll tell ’em what you say. No, it was a 
pure accident. Yes; good-night, papa.”

Then the same voice, exerting itself so as to be heard in a 

distant part of the house, remarks:

“You’ve got to come upstairs again. Pa says it isn’t time yet 

to get up.”

You  return  to  bed,  and  lie  listening  to  somebody  being 
dragged  upstairs,  evidently  against  their  will.  By  a  thought-
ful arrangement the spare rooms at “Beggarbush” are exactly 
underneath the nurseries. The same somebody, you conclude, 
still offering the most creditable opposition, is being put back 
into bed. You can follow the contest with much exactitude, be-
cause every time the body is flung down upon the spring mat-
tress, the bedstead, just above your head, makes a sort of jump; 
while  every  time  the  body  succeeds  in  struggling  out  again, 
you  are  aware  by  the  thud  upon  the  floor.  After  a  time  the 
struggle wanes, or maybe the bed collapses; and you drift back 
into sleep. But the next moment, or what seems to be the next 
moment, you again open your eyes under the consciousness of 
a presence. The door is being held ajar, and four solemn faces, 
piled  one  on  top  of  the  other,  are  peering  at  you,  as  though 
you were some natural curiosity kept in this particular room. 
Seeing you awake, the top face, walking calmly over the other 
three, comes in and sits on the bed in a friendly attitude.

— 242 —

“Oh!”  it  says, “we  didn’t  know  you  were  awake.  I’ve  been 

awake some time.”

“So I gather,” you reply, shortly.
“Pa doesn’t like us to get up too early,” it continues. “He says 
everybody else in the house is liable to be disturbed if we get 
up. So, of course, we mustn’t.”

The tone is that of gentle resignation. It is instinct with the 
spirit of virtuous pride, arising from the consciousness of self-
sacrifice.

“Don’t you call this being up?” you suggest.
“Oh,  no;  we’re  not  really  up,  you  know,  because  we’re  not 
properly  dressed.”  The  fact  is  self-evident. “Pa’s  always  very 
tired  in  the  morning,”  the  voice  continues; “of  course,  that’s 
because he works hard all day. Are you ever tired in the morn-
ing?”

At  this  point  he  turns  and  notices,  for  the  first  time,  that 
the three other children have also entered, and are sitting in a 
semi-circle on the floor. From their attitude it is clear they have 
mistaken the whole thing for one of the slower forms of enter-
tainment, some comic lecture or conjuring exhibition, and are 
waiting patiently for you to get out of bed and do something. It 
shocks him, the idea of their being in the guest’s bedchamber. 
He  peremptorily  orders  them  out.  They  do  not  answer  him, 
they do not argue; in dead silence, and with one accord they 
fall upon him. All you can see from the bed is a confused tangle 
of waving arms and legs, suggestive of an intoxicated octopus 
trying to find bottom. Not a word is spoken; that seems to be 
the etiquette of the thing. If you are sleeping in your pyjamas, 
you spring from the bed, and only add to the confusion; if you 
are wearing a less showy garment, you stop where you are and 
shout  commands,  which  are  utterly  unheeded.  The  simplest 
plan is to leave it to the eldest boy. He does get them out after a 
while, and closes the door upon them. It re-opens immediately, 
and one, generally Muriel, is shot back into the room. She en-
ters as from a catapult. She is handicapped by having long hair, 
which can be used as a convenient handle. Evidently aware of 

— 243 —

this natural disadvantage, she clutches it herself tightly in one 
hand, and punches with the other. He opens the door again, 
and  cleverly  uses  her  as  a  battering-ram  against  the  wall  of 
those without. You can hear the dull crash as her head enters 
among them, and scatters them. When the victory is complete, 
he comes back and resumes his seat on the bed. There is no bit-
terness about him; he has forgotten the whole incident.

“I like the morning,” he says, “don’t you?”
“Some mornings,” you agree, “are all right; others are not so 

peaceful.”

He takes no notice of your exception; a far-away look steals 

over his somewhat ethereal face.

“I should like to die in the morning,” he says; “everything is 

so beautiful then.”

“Well,”  you  answer, “perhaps  you  will,  if  your  father  ever 
invites an irritable man to come and sleep here, and doesn’t 
warn him beforehand.”

He  descends  from  his  contemplative  mood,  and  becomes 

himself again.

“It’s jolly in the garden,” he suggests; “you wouldn’t like to 

get up and have a game of cricket, would you?”

It was not the idea with which you went to bed, but now, as 
things have turned out, it seems as good a plan as lying there 
hopelessly awake; and you agree.

You  learn,  later  in  the  day,  that  the  explanation  of  the 
proceeding is that you, unable to sleep, woke up early in the 
morning, and thought you would like a game of cricket. The 
children,  taught  to  be  ever  courteous  to  guests,  felt  it  their 
duty to humour you. Mrs. Harris remarks at breakfast that at 
least you might have seen to it that the children were properly 
dressed before you took them out; while Harris points out to 
you, pathetically, how, by your one morning’s example and en-
couragement, you have undone his labour of months.

On this Wednesday morning, George, it seems, clamoured 
to  get  up  at  a  quarter-past  five,  and  persuaded  them  to  let 
him teach them cycling tricks round the cucumber frames on 

— 244 —

Harris’s new wheel. Even Mrs. Harris, however, did not blame 
George on this occasion; she felt intuitively the idea could not 
have been entirely his.

It  is  not  that  the  Harris  children  have  the  faintest  notion 
of  avoiding  blame  at  the  expense  of  a  friend  and  comrade. 
One  and  all  they  are  honesty  itself  in  accepting  responsibil-
ity for their own misdeeds. It simply is, that is how the thing 
presents  itself  to  their  understanding. When  you  explain  to 
them that you had no original intention of getting up at five 
o’clock in the morning to play cricket on the croquet lawn, or 
to mimic the history of the early Church by shooting with a 
cross-bow at dolls tied to a tree; that as a matter of fact, left to 
your own initiative, you would have slept peacefully till roused 
in Christian fashion with a cup of tea at eight, they are firstly 
astonished, secondly apologetic, and thirdly sincerely contrite. 
In the present instance, waiving the purely academic question 
whether the awakening of George at a little before five was due 
to natural instinct on his part, or to the accidental passing of 
a home-made boomerang through his bedroom window, the 
dear children frankly admitted that the blame for his uprising 
was their own. As the eldest boy said:

“We  ought  to  have  remembered  that  Uncle  George  had  a 
long  day,  before  him,  and  we  ought  to  have  dissuaded  him 
from getting up. I blame myself entirely.”

But an occasional change of habit does nobody any harm; 
and besides, as Harris and I agreed, it was good training for 
George.  In  the  Black  Forest  we  should  be  up  at  five  every 
morning; that we had determined on. Indeed, George himself 
had suggested half-past four, but Harris and I had argued that 
five would be early enough as an average; that would enable 
us to be on our machines by six, and to break the back of our 
journey  before  the  heat  of  the  day  set  in.  Occasionally  we 
might start a little earlier, but not as a habit.

I myself was up that morning at five. This was earlier than 
I  had  intended.  I  had  said  to  myself  on  going  to  sleep, “Six 
o’clock, sharp!”

— 245 —

There  are  men  I  know  who  can  wake  themselves  at  any 
time to the minute. They say to themselves literally, as they lay 
their heads upon the pillow, “Four-thirty,” “Four-forty-five,” or 
“Five-fifteen,” as the case may be; and as the clock strikes they 
open their eyes. It is very wonderful this; the more one dwells 
upon it, the greater the mystery grows. Some Ego within us, 
acting quite independently of our conscious self, must be ca-
pable of counting the hours while we sleep. Unaided by clock 
or sun, or any other medium known to our five senses, it keeps 
watch through the darkness. At the exact moment it whispers 
“Time!” and we awake. The work of an old riverside fellow I 
once talked with called him to be out of bed each morning half 
an hour before high tide. He told me that never once had he 
overslept himself by a minute. Latterly, he never even troubled 
to work out the tide for himself. He would lie down tired, and 
sleep a dreamless sleep, and each morning at a different hour 
this  ghostly  watchman,  true  as  the  tide  itself,  would  silently 
call him. Did the man’s spirit haunt through the darkness the 
muddy river stairs; or had it knowledge of the ways of Nature? 
Whatever the process, the man himself was unconscious of it.
In my own case my inward watchman is, perhaps, somewhat 
out  of  practice.  He  does  his  best;  but  he  is  over-anxious;  he 
worries himself, and loses count. I say to him, maybe, “Five-
thirty, please;” and he wakes me with a start at half-past two. I 
look at my watch. He suggests that, perhaps, I forgot to wind it 
up. I put it to my ear; it is still going. He thinks, maybe, some-
thing has happened to it; he is confident himself it is half-past 
five, if not a little later. To satisfy him, I put on a pair of slip-
pers  and  go  downstairs  to  inspect  the  dining-room  clock. 
What happens to a man when he wanders about the house in 
the  middle  of  the  night,  clad  in  a  dressing-gown  and  a  pair 
of  slippers,  there  is  no  need  to  recount;  most  men  know  by 
experience.  Everything — especially  everything  with  a  sharp 
corner — takes a cowardly delight in hitting him. When you are 
wearing a pair of stout boots, things get out of your way; when 
you  venture  among  furniture  in  woolwork  slippers  and  no 

— 246 —

socks, it comes at you and kicks you. I return to bed bad tem-
pered, and refusing to listen to his further absurd suggestion 
that all the clocks in the house have entered into a conspiracy 
against me, take half an hour to get to sleep again. From four 
to five he wakes me every ten minutes. I wish I had never said 
a word to him about the thing. At five o’clock he goes to sleep 
himself, worn out, and leaves it to the girl, who does it half an 
hour later than usual.

On  this  particular  Wednesday  he  worried  me  to  such  an 
extent, that I got up at five simply to be rid of him. I did not 
know what to do with myself. Our train did not leave till eight; 
all our luggage had been packed and sent on the night before, 
together with the bicycles, to Fenchurch Street Station. I went 
into my study; I thought I would put in an hour’s writing. The 
early morning, before one has breakfasted, is not, I take it, a 
good season for literary effort. I wrote three paragraphs of a 
story, and then read them over to myself. Some unkind things 
have been said about my work; but nothing has yet been writ-
ten which would have done justice to those three paragraphs. 
I threw them into the waste-paper basket, and sat trying to re-
member what, if any, charitable institutions provided pensions 
for decayed authors.

To escape from this train of reflection, I put a golf-ball in my 
pocket, and selecting a driver, strolled out into the paddock. A 
couple of sheep were browsing there, and they followed and 
took a keen interest in my practice. The one was a kindly, sym-
pathetic old party. I do not think she understood the game; I 
think it was my doing this innocent thing so early in the morn-
ing that appealed to her. At every stroke I made she bleated:

“Go-o-o-d, go-o-o-d ind-e-e-d!”
She seemed as pleased as if she had done it herself.
As for the other one, she was a cantankerous, disagreeable 

old thing, as discouraging to me as her friend was helpful.

“Ba-a-ad, da-a-a-m ba-a-a-d!” was her comment on almost 
every  stroke. As  a  matter  of  fact,  some  were  really  excellent 

— 247 —

strokes; but she did it just to be contradictory, and for the sake 
of irritating. I could see that.

By  a  most  regrettable  accident,  one  of  my  swiftest  balls 
struck the good sheep on the nose. And at that the bad sheep 
laughed — laughed distinctly and undoubtedly, a husky, vulgar 
laugh;  and,  while  her  friend  stood  glued  to  the  ground,  too 
astonished  to  move,  she  changed  her  note  for  the  first  time 
and bleated:

“Go-o-o-d, ve-e-ry go-o-o-d! Be-e-e-est sho-o-o-ot he-e-e’s 

ma-a-a-de!”

I would have given half-a-crown if it had been she I had hit 
instead of the other one. It is ever the good and amiable who 
suffer in this world.

I had wasted more time than I had intended in the paddock, 
and when Ethelbertha came to tell me it was half-past seven, 
and the breakfast was on the table, I remembered that I had 
not shaved. It vexes Ethelbertha my shaving quickly. She fears 
that to outsiders it may suggest a poor-spirited attempt at sui-
cide, and that in consequence it may get about the neighbour-
hood that we are not happy together. As a further argument, 
she has also hinted that my appearance is not of the kind that 
can be trifled with.

On the whole, I was just as glad not to be able to take a long 
farewell  of  Ethelbertha;  I  did  not  want  to  risk  her  breaking 
down. But I should have liked more opportunity to say a few 
farewell words of advice to the children, especially as regards 
my  fishing  rod,  which  they  will  persist  in  using  for  cricket 
stumps; and I hate having to run for a train. Quarter of a mile 
from the station I overtook George and Harris; they were also 
running. In their case — so Harris informed me, jerkily, while 
we trotted side by side — it was the new kitchen stove that was 
to blame. This was the first morning they had tried it, and from 
some cause or other it had blown up the kidneys and scalded 
the cook. He said he hoped that by the time we returned they 
would have got more used to it.

We caught the train by the skin of our teeth, as the saying is, 

— 248 —

and reflecting upon the events of the morning, as we sat gasp-
ing in the carriage, there passed vividly before my mind the 
panorama of my Uncle Podger, as on two hundred and fifty 
days in the year he would start from Ealing Common by the 
nine-thirteen train to Moorgate Street.

From  my  Uncle  Podger’s  house  to  the  railway  station  was 

eight minutes’ walk. What my uncle always said was:

“Allow yourself a quarter of an hour, and take it easily.”
What he always did was to start five minutes before the time 
and run. I do not know why, but this was the custom of the 
suburb.  Many  stout  City  gentlemen  lived  at  Ealing  in  those 
days — I believe some live there still — and caught early trains 
to Town. They all started late; they all carried a black bag and 
a newspaper in one hand, and an umbrella in the other; and 
for the last quarter of a mile to the station, wet or fine, they 
all ran.

Folks with nothing else to do, nursemaids chiefly and errand 
boys, with now and then a perambulating costermonger add-
ed, would gather on the common of a fine morning to watch 
them pass, and cheer the most deserving. It was not a showy 
spectacle. They did not run well, they did not even run fast; 
but they were earnest, and they did their best. The exhibition 
appealed less to one’s sense of art than to one’s natural admira-
tion for conscientious effort.

Occasionally  a  little  harmless  betting  would  take  place 

among the crowd.

’fore ’e gets there!”

“Two to one agin the old gent in the white weskit!”
“Ten to one on old Blowpipes, bar he don’t roll over hisself 

“Heven  money  on  the  Purple  Hemperor!” — a  nickname 
bestowed  by  a  youth  of  entomological  tastes  upon  a  certain 
retired  military  neighbour  of  my  uncle’s, — a  gentleman  of 
imposing appearance when stationary, but apt to colour highly 
under exercise.

My  uncle  and  the  others  would  write  to  the  Ealing  Press 
complaining  bitterly  concerning  the  supineness  of  the  local 

— 249 —

police; and the editor would add spirited leaders upon the De-
cay of Courtesy among the Lower Orders, especially through-
out the Western Suburbs. But no good ever resulted.

It was not that my uncle did not rise early enough; it was 
that troubles came to him at the last moment. The first thing 
he would do after breakfast would be to lose his newspaper. We 
always knew when Uncle Podger had lost anything, by the ex-
pression of astonished indignation with which, on such occa-
sions, he would regard the world in general. It never occurred 
to my Uncle Podger to say to himself:

“I am a careless old man. I lose everything: I never know 
where I have put anything. I am quite incapable of finding it 
again for myself. In this respect I must be a perfect nuisance to 
everybody about me. I must set to work and reform myself.”

On the contrary, by some peculiar course of reasoning, he 
had  convinced  himself  that  whenever  he  lost  a  thing  it  was 
everybody else’s fault in the house but his own.

“I had it in my hand here not a minute ago!” he would ex-

claim.

gest.

From his tone you would have thought he was living sur-
rounded  by  conjurers,  who  spirited  away  things  from  him 
merely to irritate him.

“Could you have left it in the garden?” my aunt would sug-

“What should I want to leave it in the garden for? I don’t 
want a paper in the garden; I want the paper in the train with 
me.”

“You haven’t put it in your pocket?”
“God  bless  the  woman!  Do  you  think  I  should  be  stand-
ing here at five minutes to nine looking for it if I had it in my 
pocket all the while? Do you think I’m a fool?”

Here somebody would explain, “What’s this?” and hand him 

from somewhere a paper neatly folded.

“I do wish people would leave my things alone,” he would 

growl, snatching at it savagely.

— 250 —

He would open his bag to put it in, and then glancing at it, 

he would pause, speechless with sense of injury.

“What’s the matter?” aunt would ask.
“The  day  before  yesterday’s!”  he  would  answer,  too  hurt 

even to shout, throwing the paper down upon the table.

If only sometimes it had been yesterday’s it would have been 
a change. But it was always the day before yesterday’s; except 
on Tuesday; then it would be Saturday’s.

We would find it for him eventually; as often as not he was 
sitting on it. And then he would smile, not genially, but with 
the weariness that comes to a man who feels that fate has cast 
his lot among a band of hopeless idiots.

“All the time, right in front of your noses — !” He would not 

finish the sentence; he prided himself on his self-control.

This  settled,  he  would  start  for  the  hall,  where  it  was  the 
custom of my Aunt Maria to have the children gathered, ready 
to say good-bye to him.

My aunt never left the house herself, if only to make a call 
next  door,  without  taking  a  tender  farewell  of  every  inmate. 
One never knew, she would say, what might happen.

One of them, of course, was sure to be missing, and the mo-
ment  this  was  noticed  all  the  other  six,  without  an  instant’s 
hesitation, would scatter with a whoop to find it. Immediately 
they  were  gone  it  would  turn  up  by  itself  from  somewhere 
quite  near,  always  with  the  most  reasonable  explanation  for 
its  absence;  and  would  at  once  start  off  after  the  others  to 
explain to them that it was found. In this way, five minutes at 
least would be taken up in everybody’s looking for everybody 
else, which was just sufficient time to allow my uncle to find 
his umbrella and lose his hat. Then, at last, the group reassem-
bled in the hall, the drawing-room clock would commence to 
strike nine. It possessed a cold, penetrating chime that always 
had  the  effect  of  confusing  my  uncle.  In  his  excitement  he 
would  kiss  some  of  the  children  twice  over,  pass  by  others, 
forget whom he had kissed and whom he hadn’t, and have to 
begin  all  over  again.  He  used  to  say  he  believed  they  mixed 

— 251 —

themselves up on purpose, and I am not prepared to maintain 
that the charge was altogether false. To add to his troubles, one 
child always had a sticky face; and that child would always be 
the most affectionate.

If  things  were  going  too  smoothly,  the  eldest  boy  would 
come out with some tale about all the clocks in the house be-
ing five minutes slow, and of his having been late for school 
the previous day in consequence. This would send my uncle 
rushing impetuously down to the gate, where he would recol-
lect that he had with him neither his bag nor his umbrella. All 
the children that my aunt could not stop would charge after 
him, two of them struggling for the umbrella, the others surg-
ing round the bag. And when they returned we would discover 
on the hall table the most important thing of all that he had 
forgotten, and wondered what he would say about it when he 
came home.

We arrived at Waterloo a little after nine, and at once pro-
ceeded  to  put  George’s  experiment  into  operation.  Opening 
the book at the chapter entitled “At the Cab Rank,” we walked 
up to a hansom, raised our hats, and wished the driver “Good-
morning.”

This man was not to be outdone in politeness by any for-
eigner, real or imitation. Calling to a friend named “Charles” 
to “hold the steed,” he sprang from his box, and returned to us 
a bow, that would have done credit to Mr. Turveydrop himself. 
Speaking apparently in the name of the nation, he welcomed 
us to England, adding a regret that Her Majesty was not at the 
moment in London.

We could not reply to him in kind. Nothing of this sort had 
been anticipated by the book. We called him “coachman,” at 
which he again bowed to the pavement, and asked him if he 
would have the goodness to drive us to the Westminster Bridge 
road.

He laid his hand upon his heart, and said the pleasure would 

be his.

— 252 —

Taking the third sentence in the chapter, George asked him 

what his fare would be.

The question, as introducing a sordid element into the con-
versation, seemed to hurt his feelings. He said he never took 
money  from  distinguished  strangers;  he  suggested  a  souve-
nir — a diamond scarf pin, a gold snuffbox, some little trifle of 
that sort by which he could remember us.

As a small crowd had collected, and as the joke was drifting 
rather too far in the cabman’s direction, we climbed in without 
further parley, and were driven away amid cheers. We stopped 
the cab at a boot shop a little past Astley’s Theatre that looked 
the sort of place we wanted. It was one of those overfed shops 
that the moment their shutters are taken down in the morn-
ing disgorge their goods all round them. Boxes of boots stood 
piled on the pavement or in the gutter opposite. Boots hung 
in festoons about its doors and windows. Its sun-blind was as 
some grimy vine, bearing bunches of black and brown boots. 
Inside, the shop was a bower of boots. The man, when we en-
tered, was busy with a chisel and hammer opening a new crate 
full of boots.

George raised his hat, and said “Good-morning.”
The man did not even turn round. He struck me from the 
first  as  a  disagreeable  man.  He  grunted  something  which 
might have been “Good-morning,” or might not, and went on 
with his work.

George said: “I have been recommended to your shop by my 

friend, Mr. X.”

In  response,  the  man  should  have  said: “Mr.  X.  is  a  most 
worthy gentleman; it will give me the greatest pleasure to serve 
any friend of his.”

What  he  did  say  was:  “Don’t  know  him;  never  heard  of 

him.”

This was disconcerting. The book gave three or four meth-
ods  of  buying  boots;  George  had  carefully  selected  the  one 
centred  round “Mr.  X,”  as  being  of  all  the  most  courtly. You 
talked a good deal with the shopkeeper about this “Mr. X,” and 

— 253 —

then, when by this means friendship and understanding had 
been established, you slid naturally and gracefully into the im-
mediate object of your coming, namely, your desire for boots, 
“cheap and good.” This gross, material man cared, apparently, 
nothing for the niceties of retail dealing. It was necessary with 
such an one to come to business with brutal directness. George 
abandoned “Mr. X,” and turning back to a previous page, took 
a sentence at random. It was not a happy selection; it was a 
speech that would have been superfluous made to any boot-
maker. Under the present circumstances, threatened and sti-
fled as we were on every side by boots, it possessed the dignity 
of positive imbecilitiy. It ran: — “One has told me that you have 
here boots for sale.”

For the first time the man put down his hammer and chisel, 
and looked at us. He spoke slowly, in a thick and husky voice. 
He said:

“What d’ye think I keep boots for — to smell ’em?”
He was one of those men that begin quietly and grow more 
angry as they proceed, their wrongs apparently working within 
them like yeast.

“What  d’ye  think  I  am,”  he  continued, “a  boot  collector? 
What d’ye think I’m running this shop for — my health? D’ye 
think I love the boots, and can’t bear to part with a pair? D’ye 
think I hang ’em about here to look at ’em? Ain’t there enough 
of ’em? Where d’ye think you are — in an international exhibi-
tion of boots? What d’ye think these boots are — a historical 
collection? Did you ever hear of a man keeping a boot shop 
and  not  selling  boots?  D’ye  think  I  decorate  the  shop  with 
’em  to  make  it  look  pretty? What  d’ye  take  me  for — a  prize 
idiot?”

I  have  always  maintained  that  these  conversation  books 
are never of any real use. What we wanted was some English 
equivalent for the well-known German idiom: “Behalten Sie 
Ihr Haar auf.”

Nothing of the sort was to be found in the book from begin-
ning to end. However, I will do George the credit to admit he 

— 254 —

chose the very best sentence that was to be found therein and 
applied it. He said:.

“I will come again, when, perhaps, you will have some more 

boots to show me. Till then, adieu!”

With that we returned to our cab and drove away, leaving 
the man standing in the centre of his boot-bedecked doorway 
addressing remarks to us. What he said, I did not hear, but the 
passers-by appeared to find it interesting.

George  was  for  stopping  at  another  boot  shop  and  trying 
the  experiment  afresh;  he  said  he  really  did  want  a  pair  of 
bedroom  slippers.  But  we  persuaded  him  to  postpone  their 
purchase  until  our  arrival  in  some  foreign  city,  where  the 
tradespeople are no doubt more inured to this sort of talk, or 
else more naturally amiable. On the subject of the hat, howev-
er, he was adamant. He maintained that without that he could 
not travel, and, accordingly, we pulled up at a small shop in the 
Blackfriars Road.

The proprietor of this shop was a cheery, bright-eyed little 

man, and he helped us rather than hindered us.

When George asked him in the words of the book, “Have 
you  any  hats?”  he  did  not  get  angry;  he  just  stopped  and 
thoughtfully scratched his chin.

“Hats,” said he. “Let me think. Yes” — here a smile of posi-
tive pleasure broke over his genial countenance — “yes, now I 
come to think of it, I believe I have a hat. But, tell me, why do 
you ask me?”

George explained to him that he wished to purchase a cap, 
a travelling cap, but the essence of the transaction was that it 
was to be a “good cap.”
The man’s face fell.
“Ah,” he remarked, “there, I am afraid, you have me. Now, if 
you had wanted a bad cap, not worth the price asked for it; a 
cap good for nothing but to clean windows with, I could have 
found you the very thing. But a good cap — no; we don’t keep 
them. But wait a minute,” he continued, — on seeing the disap-
pointment that spread over George’s expressive countenance, 

— 255 —

“don’t be in a hurry. I have a cap here” — he went to a drawer 
and opened it — “it is not a good cap, but it is not so bad as 
most of the caps I sell.”

He brought it forward, extended on his palm.
“What do you think of that?” he asked. “Could you put up 

with that?”

George fitted it on before the glass, and, choosing another 

remark from the book, said:

sider that it becomes me?”

“This hat fits me sufficiently well, but, tell me, do you con-

The man stepped back and took a bird’s-eye view.
“Candidly,” he replied, “I can’t say that it does.”
He  turned  from  George,  and  addressed  himself  to  Harris 

and myself.

“Your friend’s beauty,” said he, “I should describe as elusive. 
It is there, but you can easily miss it. Now, in that cap, to my 
mind, you do miss it.”

At that point it occurred to George that he had had suffi-

cient fun with this particular man. He said:

“That  is  all  right.  We  don’t  want  to  lose  the  train.  How 

much?”

Answered the man: “The price of that cap, sir, which, in my 
opinion, is twice as much as it is worth, is four-and-six. Would 
you like it wrapped up in brown paper, sir, or in white?”

George said he would take it as it was, paid the man four-

and-six in-silver, and went out. Harris and I followed.

At Fenchurch Street we compromised with our cabman for 
five shillings. He made us another courtly bow, and begged us 
to remember him to the Emperor of Austria.

Comparing views in the train, we agreed that we had lost 
the game by two points to one; and George, who was evidently 
disappointed, threw the book out of window.

We found our luggage and the bicycles safe on the boat, and 

with the tide at twelve dropped down the river.

care to.”

A STORY is told of a Scotchman who, loving a lassie, desired 
her for his wife. But he possessed the prudence of his race. He 
had noticed in his circle many an otherwise promising union 
result in disappointment and dismay, purely in consequence of 
the false estimate formed by bride or bridegroom concerning 
the imagined perfectability of the other. He determined that in 
his own case no collapsed ideal should be possible. Therefore, 
it was that his proposal took the following form:

“I’m but a puir lad, Jennie; I hae nae siller to offer ye, and 

“Ah, but ye hae yoursel’, Davie!”
“An’ I’m wishfu’ it wa’ onything else, lassie. I’m nae but a puir 

ill-seasoned loon, Jennie.”

“Na,  na;  there’s  mony  a  lad  mair  ill-looking  than  yoursel’, 

“I hae na seen him, lass, and I’m just a-thinkin’ I shouldna’ 

“Better a plain man, Davie, that ye can depend a’ than ane 
that would be a speirin’ at the lassies, a-bringin’ trouble into the 
hame wi’ his flouting ways.”

“Dinna ye reckon on that, Jennie; it’s nae the bonniest Bub-
bly Jock that mak’s the most feathers to fly in the kailyard. I 
was ever a lad to run after the petticoats, as is weel kent; an’ it’s 
a weary handfu’ I’ll be to ye, I’m thinkin’.”

“Ah, but ye hae a kind heart, Davie! an’ ye love me weel. I’m 

sure on’t.”

“I like ye weel enoo’, Jennie, though I canna say how long the 

— 257 —

feeling may bide wi’ me; an’ I’m kind enoo’ when I hae my ain 
way, an’ naethin’ happens to put me oot. But I hae the deevil’s 
ain temper, as my mither call tell ye, an’ like my puir fayther, 
I’m a-thinkin’, I’ll grow nae better as I grow mair auld.”

“Ay, but ye’re sair hard upon yersel’, Davie. Ye’re an honest 
lad. I ken ye better than ye ken yersel’, an’ ye’ll mak a guid hame 
for me.”

“Maybe,  Jennie!  But  I  hae  my  doots.  It’s  a  sair  thing  for 
wife an’ bairns when the guid man canna keep awa’ frae the 
glass; an’ when the scent of the whusky comes to me it’s just 
as though I hae’d the throat o’ a Loch Tay salmon; it just gaes 
doon an’ doon, an’ there’s nae filling o’ me.”

“Ay, but ye’re a guid man when ye’re sober, Davie.”
“Maybe I’ll be that, Jennie, if I’m nae disturbed.”
“An’ ye’ll bide wi’ me, Davie, an’ work for me?”
“I  see  nae  reason  why  I  shouldna  bide  wi’  yet  Jennie;  but 
dinna  ye  clack  aboot  work  to  me,  for  I  just  canna  bear  the 
thoct o’t.”

“Anyhow, ye’ll do your best, Davie? As the minister says, nae 

man can do mair than that.”

“An’ it’s a puir best that mine’ll be, Jennie, and I’m nae sae 
sure  ye’ll  hae  ower  muckle  even  o’  that. We’re  a’  weak,  sinfu’ 
creatures, Jennie, an’ ye’d hae some deefficulty to find a man 
weaker or mair sinfu’ than mysel’.”

“Weel, weel, ye hae a truthfu’ tongue, Davie. Mony a lad will 
mak fine promises to a puir lassie, only to break ’em an’ her 
heart wi’ ’em. Ye speak me fair, Davie, and I’m thinkin’ I’ll just 
tak ye, an’ see what comes o’t.”

Concerning what did come of it, the story is silent, but one 
feels  that  under  no  circumstances  had  the  lady  any  right  to 
complain of her bargain. Whether she ever did or did not — for 
women  do  not  invariably  order  their  tongues  according  to 
logic, nor men either for the matter of that — Davie, himself, 
must have had the satisfaction of reflecting that all reproaches 
were undeserved.

I  wish  to  be  equally  frank  with  the  reader  of  this  book.  I 

— 258 —

wish here conscientiously to let forth its shortcomings. I wish 
no one to read this book under a misapprehension.
There will be no useful information in this book.
Anyone who should think that with the aid of this book he 
would be able to make a tour through Germany and the Black 
Forest would probably lose himself before he got to the Nore. 
That, at all events, would be the best thing that could happen 
to him. The farther away from home he got, the greater only 
would be his difficulties.

I do not regard the conveyance of useful information as my 
forte. This belief was not inborn with me; it has been driven 
home upon me by experience.

In  my  early  journalistic  days,  I  served  upon  a  paper,  the 
forerunner  of  many  very  popular  periodicals  of  the  present 
day. Our boast was that we combined instruction with amuse-
ment; as to what should be regarded as affording amusement 
and what instruction, the reader judged for himself. We gave 
advice  to  people  about  to  marry — long,  earnest  advice  that 
would, had they followed it, have made our circle of readers 
the envy of the whole married world. We told our subscrib-
ers how to make fortunes by keeping rabbits, giving facts and 
figures. The thing that must have surprised them was that we 
ourselves did not give up journalism and start rabbit-farming. 
Often and often have I proved conclusively from authoritative 
sources how a man starting a rabbit farm with twelve selected 
rabbits and a little judgment must, at the end of three years, 
be in receipt of an income of two thousand a year, rising rap-
idly; he simply could not help himself. He might not want the 
money. He might not know what to do with it when he had 
it. But there it was for him. I have never met a rabbit farmer 
myself worth two thousand a year, though I have known many 
start  with  the  twelve  necessary,  assorted  rabbits.  Something 
has always gone wrong somewhere; maybe the continued at-
mosphere of a rabbit farm saps the judgment.

We told our readers how many bald-headed men there were 
in Iceland, and for all we knew our figures may have been cor-

— 259 —

rect; how many red herrings placed tail to mouth it would take 
to reach from London to Rome, which must have been useful 
to anyone desirous of laying down a line of red herrings from 
London to Rome, enabling him to order in the right quantity 
at the beginning; how many words the average woman spoke 
in a day; and other such like items of information calculated 
to  make  them  wise  and  great  beyond  the  readers  of  other 
journals.

We told them how to cure fits in cats. Personally I do not 
believe,  and  I  did  not  believe  then,  that  you  can  cure  fits  in 
cats. If I had a cat subject to fits I should advertise it for sale, 
or even give it away. But our duty was to supply information 
when asked for. Some fool wrote, clamouring to know; and I 
spent  the  best  part  of  a  morning  seeking  knowledge  on  the 
subject. I found what I wanted at length at the end of an old 
cookery book. What it was doing there I have never been able 
to  understand.  It  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  proper  subject 
of the book whatever; there was no suggestion that you could 
make anything savoury out of a cat, even when you had cured 
it of its fits. The authoress had just thrown in this paragraph 
out of pure generosity. I can only say that I wish she had left it 
out; it was the cause of a deal of angry correspondence and of 
the loss of four subscribers to the paper, if not more. The man 
said the result of following our advice had been two pounds 
worth  of  damage  to  his  kitchen  crockery,  to  say  nothing  of 
a  broken  window  and  probable  blood  poisoning  to  himself; 
added to which the cat’s fits were worse than before. And yet 
it was a simple enough recipe. You held the cat between your 
legs, gently, so as not to hurt it, and with a pair of scissors made 
a sharp, clean cut in its tail. You did not cut off any part of the 
tail; you were to be careful not to do that; you only made an 
incision.

As we explained to the man, the garden or the coal cellar 
would have been the proper place for the operation; no one 
but an idiot would have attempted to perform it in a kitchen, 
and without help.

— 260 —

We gave them hints on etiquette. We told them how to ad-
dress peers and bishops; also how to eat soup. We instructed 
shy young men how to acquire easy grace in drawing-rooms. 
We taught dancing to both sexes by the aid of diagrams. We 
solved their religious doubts for them, and supplied them with 
a code of morals that would have done credit to a stained-glass 
window.

The  paper  was  not  a  financial  success,  it  was  some  years 
before  its  time,  and  the  consequence  was  that  our  staff  was 
limited. My own apartment, I remember, included “Advice to 
Mothers” — I  wrote  that  with  the  assistance  of  my  landlady, 
who, having divorced one husband and buried four children, 
was, I considered, a reliable authority on all domestic matters; 
“Hints  on  Furnishing  and  Household  Decorations — with 
Designs”  a  column  of  “Literary  Counsel  to  Beginners” — I 
sincerely hope my guidance was of better service to them than 
it has ever proved to myself; and our weekly article, “Straight 
Talks to Young Men,” signed “Uncle Henry.” A kindly, genial 
old  fellow  was “Uncle  Henry,”  with  wide  and  varied  experi-
ence, and a sympathetic attitude towards the rising generation. 
He had been through trouble himself in his far back youth, and 
knew most things. Even to this day I read of “Uncle Henry’s” 
advice, and, though I say it who should not, it still seems to me 
good, sound advice. I often think that had I followed “Uncle 
Henry’s” counsel closer I would have been wiser, made fewer 
mistakes, felt better satisfied with myself than is now the case.
A  quiet,  weary  little  woman,  who  lived  in  a  bed-sitting 
room off the Tottenham Court Road, and who had a husband 
in  a  lunatic  asylum,  did  our “Cooking  Column,” “Hints  on 
Education” — we  were  full  of  hints, — and  a  page  and  a  half 
of “Fashionable  Intelligence,”  written  in  the  pertly  personal 
style which even yet has not altogether disappeared, so I am 
informed, from modern journalism: “I must tell you about the 
divine frock I wore at ‘Glorious Goodwood’ last week. Prince 
C. — but there, I really must not repeat all the things the silly 

— 261 —

fellow says; he is too foolish — and the dear Countess, I fancy, 
was just the weeish bit jealous” — and so on.

Poor little woman! I see her now in the shabby grey alpaca, 
with  the  inkstains  on  it.  Perhaps  a  day  at “Glorious  Good-
wood,” or anywhere else in the fresh air, might have put some 
colour into her cheeks.

Our  proprietor — one  of  the  most  unashamedly  ignorant 
men I ever met — I remember his gravely informing a corre-
spondent once that Ben Jonson had written Rabelais to pay for 
his mother’s funeral, and only laughing good-naturedly when 
his mistakes were pointed out to him — wrote with the aid of 
a cheap encyclopedia the pages devoted to “General Informa-
tion,” and did them on the whole remarkably well; while our 
office boy, with an excellent pair of scissors for his assistant, 
was responsible for our supply of “Wit and Humour.”

It was hard work, and the pay was poor, what sustained us 
was the consciousness that we were instructing and improv-
ing  our  fellow  men  and  women.  Of  all  games  in  the  world, 
the one most universally and eternally popular is the game of 
school. You collect six children, and put them on a doorstep, 
while you walk up and down with the book and cane. We play 
it when babies, we play it when boys and girls, we play it when 
men and women, we play it as, lean and slippered, we totter 
towards the grave. It never palls upon, it never wearies us. Only 
one thing mars it: the tendency of one and all of the other six 
children to clamour for their turn with the book and the cane. 
The reason, I am sure, that journalism is so popular a calling, 
in spite of its many drawbacks, is this: each journalist feels he 
is the boy walking up and down with the cane. The Govern-
ment, the Classes, and the Masses, Society, Art, and Literature, 
are the other children sitting on the doorstep. He instructs and 
improves them.

But I digress. It was to excuse my present permanent disin-
clination to be the vehicle of useful information that I recalled 
these matters. Let us now return.

Somebody, signing himself “Balloonist,” had written to ask 

— 262 —

concerning  the  manufacture  of  hydrogen  gas.  It  is  an  easy 
thing to manufacture — at least, so I gathered after reading up 
the subject at the British Museum; yet I did warn “Balloonist,” 
whoever he might be, to take all necessary precaution against 
accident. What more could I have done? Ten days afterwards a 
florid-faced lady called at the office, leading by the hand what, 
she  explained,  was  her  son,  aged  twelve.  The  boy’s  face  was 
unimpressive  to  a  degree  positively  remarkable.  His  mother 
pushed him forward and took off his hat, and then I perceived 
the reason for this. He had no eyebrows whatever, and of his 
hair nothing remained but a scrubby dust, giving to his head 
the  appearance  of  a  hard-boiled  egg,  skinned  and  sprinkled 
with black pepper.

“That was a handsome lad this time last week, with natu-
rally  curly  hair,”  remarked  the  lady.  She  spoke  with  a  rising 
inflection, suggestive of the beginning of things.
“What has happened to him?” asked our chief.
“This  is  what’s  happened  to  him,”  retorted  the  lady.  She 
drew from her muff a copy of our last week’s issue, with my 
article on hydrogen gas scored in pencil, and flung it before his 
eyes. Our chief took it and read it through.
“He was ‘Balloonist’?” queried the chief.
“He was ‘Balloonist,’” admitted the lady, “the poor innocent 

child, and now look at him!”

“Maybe it’ll grow again,” suggested our chief.
“Maybe it will,” retorted the lady, her key continuing to rise, 
“and maybe it won’t. What I want to know is what you are go-
ing to do for him.”

Our chief suggested a hair wash. I thought at first she was 
going to fly at him; but for the moment she confined herself 
to words. It appears she was not thinking of a hair wash, but 
of compensation. She also made observations on the general 
character of our paper, its utility, its claim to public support, 
the sense and wisdom of its contributors.

“I really don’t see that it is our fault,” urged the chief — he 

— 263 —

was a mild-mannered man; “he asked for information, and he 
got it.”

“Don’t you try to be funny about it,” said the lady (he had 
not meant to be funny, I am sure; levity was not his failing) “or 
you’ll get something that you haven’t asked for. Why, for two 
pins,” said the lady, with a suddenness that sent us both flying 
like scuttled chickens behind our respective chairs, “I’d come 
round and make your head like it!” I take it, she meant like the 
boy’s. She also added observations upon our chief’s personal 
appearance, that were distinctly in bad taste. She was not a nice 
woman by any means.

Myself, I am of opinion that had she brought the action she 
threatened, she would have had no case; but our chief was a 
man who had had experience of the law, and his principle was 
always to avoid it. I have heard him say:

“If  a  man  stopped  me  in  the  street  and  demanded  of  me 
my watch, I should refuse to give it to him. If he threatened to 
take it by force, I feel I should, though not a fighting man, do 
my best to protect it. If, on the other hand, he should assert his 
intention of trying to obtain it by means of an action in any 
court of law, I should take it out of my pocket and hand it to 
him, and think I had got off cheaply.”

He squared the matter with the florid-faced lady for a five-
pound note, which must have represented a month’s profits on 
the  paper;  and  she  departed,  taking  her  damaged  offspring 
with her. After she was gone, our chief spoke kindly to me. He 
said:

“Don’t think I am blaming you in the least; it is not your 
fault, it is Fate. Keep to moral advice and criticism — there you 
are distinctly good; but don’t try your hand any more on ‘Use-
ful Information.’ As I have said, it is not your fault. Your infor-
mation is correct enough — there is nothing to be said against 
that; it simply is that you are not lucky with it.”

I would that I had followed his advice always; I would have 
saved myself and other people much disaster. I see no reason 
why it should be, but so it is. If I instruct a man as to the best 

— 264 —

route between London and Rome, he loses his luggage in Swit-
zerland, or is nearly shipwrecked off Dover. If I counsel him in 
the purchase of a camera, he gets run in by the German police 
for photographing fortresses. I once took a deal of trouble to 
explain  to  a  man  how  to  marry  his  deceased  wife’s  sister  at 
Stockholm. I found out for him the time the boat left Hull and 
the best hotels to stop at. There was not a single mistake from 
beginning  to  end  in  the  information  with  which  I  supplied 
him;  no  hitch  occurred  anywhere;  yet  now  he  never  speaks 
to me.

Therefore it is that I have come to restrain my passion for 
the giving of information; therefore it is that nothing in the 
nature of practical instruction will be found, if I can help it, 
within these pages.

There will be no description of towns, no historical reminis-

cences, no architecture, no morals.

I  once  asked  an  intelligent  foreigner  what  he  thought  of 

London.

He said: “It is a very big town.”
I said: “What struck you most about it?”
He replied: “The people.”
I  said:  “Compared  with  other  towns — Paris,  Rome,  Ber-

lin, — what did you think of it?”

He  shrugged  his  shoulders.  “It  is  bigger,”  he  said;  “what 

more can one say?”

One  anthill  is  very  much  like  another.  So  many  avenues, 
wide  or  narrow,  where  the  little  creatures  swarm  in  strange 
confusion; these bustling by, important; these halting to pow-
wow  with  one  another.  These  struggling  with  big  burdens; 
those but basking in the sun. So many granaries stored with 
food; so many cells where the little things sleep, and eat, and 
love; the corner where lie their little white bones. This hive is 
larger, the next smaller. This nest lies on the sand, and another 
under the stones. This was built but yesterday, while that was 
fashioned ages ago, some say even before the swallows came; 
who knows?

— 265 —

Nor will there be found herein folk-lore or story.
Every  valley  where  lie  homesteads  has  its  song.  I  will  tell 
you the plot; you can turn it into verse and set it to music of 
your own.

There lived a lass, and there came a lad, who loved and rode 

away.

It  is  a  monotonous  song,  written  in  many  languages;  for 
the  young  man  seems  to  have  been  a  mighty  traveller.  Here 
in sentimental Germany they remember him well. So also the 
dwellers of the Blue Alsatian Mountains remember his coming 
among them; while, if my memory serves me truly, he likewise 
visited the Banks of Allan Water. A veritable Wandering Jew 
is he; for still the foolish girls listen, so they say, to the dying 
away of his hoof-beats.

In this land of many ruins, that long while ago were voice-
filled homes, linger many legends; and here again, giving you 
the essentials, I leave you to cook the dish for yourself. Take a 
human heart or two, assorted; a bundle of human passions — 
there are not many of them, half a dozen at the most; season 
with a mixture of good and evil; flavour the whole with the 
sauce of death, and serve up where and when you will. “The 
Saint’s Cell,” “The Haunted Keep,” “The Dungeon Grave,” “The 
Lover’s Leap” — call it what you will, the stew’s the same.

Lastly, in this book there will be no scenery. This is not lazi-
ness on my part; it is self-control. Nothing is easier to write 
than scenery; nothing more difficult and unnecessary to read. 
When Gibbon had to trust to travellers’ tales for a description 
of the Hellespont, and the Rhine was chiefly familiar to English 
students through the medium of Caesar’s Commentaries, it be-
hoved every globe-trotter, for whatever distance, to describe to 
the best of his ability the things that he had seen. Dr. Johnson, 
familiar with little else than the view down Fleet Street, could 
read  the  description  of  a Yorkshire  moor  with  pleasure  and 
with profit. To a cockney who had never seen higher ground 
than the Hog’s Back in Surrey, an account of Snowdon must 
have appeared exciting. But we, or rather the steam-engine and 

— 266 —

the camera for us, have changed all that. The man who plays 
tennis every year at the foot of the Matterhorn, and billiards 
on the summit of the Rigi, does not thank you for an elaborate 
and  painstaking  description  of  the  Grampian  Hills.  To  the 
average man, who has seen a dozen oil paintings, a hundred 
photographs,  a  thousand  pictures  in  the  illustrated  journals, 
and a couple of panoramas of Niagara, the word-painting of a 
waterfall is tedious.

An  American  friend  of  mine,  a  cultured  gentleman,  who 
loved poetry well enough for its own sake, told me that he had 
obtained a more correct and more satisfying idea of the Lake 
district  from  an  eighteenpenny  book  of  photographic  views 
than  from  all  the  works  of  Coleridge,  Southey,  and  Words-
worth  put  together.  I  also  remember  his  saying  concerning 
this  subject  of  scenery  in  literature,  that  he  would  thank  an 
author as much for writing an eloquent description of what he 
had just had for dinner. But this was in reference to another 
argument; namely, the proper province of each art. My friend 
maintained that just as canvas and colour were the wrong me-
diums for story telling, so word-painting was, at its best, but 
a clumsy method of conveying impressions that could much 
better be received through the eye.

As regards the question, there also lingers in my memory 
very distinctly a hot school afternoon. The class was for Eng-
lish literature, and the proceedings commenced with the read-
ing of a certain lengthy, but otherwise unobjectionable, poem. 
The  author’s  name,  I  am  ashamed  to  say,  I  have  forgotten, 
together with the title of the poem. The reading finished, we 
closed our books, and the Professor, a kindly, white-haired old 
gentleman, suggested our giving in our own words an account 
of what we had just read.

“Tell me,” said the Professor, encouragingly, “what it is all 

about.”

“Please, sir,” said the first boy — he spoke with bowed head 
and evident reluctance, as though the subject were one which, 

— 267 —

left to himself, he would never have mentioned, — “it is about 
a maiden.”

“Yes,”  agreed  the  Professor; “but  I  want  you  to  tell  me  in 
your own words. We do not speak of a maiden, you know; we 
say a girl. Yes, it is about a girl. Go on.”

“A  girl,”  repeated  the  top  boy,  the  substitution  apparently 

increasing his embarrassment, “who lived in a wood.”

“What sort of a wood?” asked the Professor.
The first boy examined his inkpot carefully, and then looked 

at the ceiling.

“Come,” urged the Professor, growing impatient, “you have 
been reading about this wood for the last ten minutes. Surely 
you can tell me something concerning it.”

“The gnarly trees, their twisted branches” — recommenced 

“No, no,” interrupted the Professor; “I do not want you to 
repeat the poem. I want you to tell me in your own words what 
sort of a wood it was where the girl lived.”

The Professor tapped his foot impatiently; the top boy made 

“Please, sir, it was the usual sort of a wood.”
“Tell  him  what  sort  of  a  wood,”  said  he,  pointing  to  the 

the top boy.

a dash for it.

second lad.

The second boy said it was a “green wood.” This annoyed 
the Professor still more; he called the second boy a blockhead, 
though  really  I  cannot  see  why,  and  passed  on  to  the  third, 
who,  for  the  last  minute,  had  been  sitting  apparently  on  hot 
plates, with his right arm waving up and down like a distracted 
semaphore signal. He would have had to say it the next second, 
whether the Professor had asked him or not; he was red in the 
face, holding his knowledge in.

“A  dark  and  gloomy  wood,”  shouted  the  third  boy,  with 

much relief to his feelings.

“A dark and gloomy wood,” repeated the Professor, with evi-

dent approval. “And why was it dark and gloomy?”

The third boy was still equal to the occasion.

— 268 —

“Because the sun could not get inside it.”
The Professor felt he had discovered the poet of the class.
“Because the sun could not get into it, or, better, because the 
sunbeams  could  not  penetrate. And  why  could  not  the  sun-
beams penetrate there?”

“Please, sir, because the leaves were too thick.”
“Very well,” said the Professor. “The girl lived in a dark and 
gloomy  wood,  through  the  leafy  canopy  of  which  the  sun-
beams were unable to pierce. Now, what grew in this wood?” 
He pointed to the fourth boy.

“Please, sir, trees, sir.”
“And what else?”
“Toadstools, sir.” This after a pause.
The Professor was not quite sure about the toadstools, but 
on referring to the text he found that the boy was right; toad-
stools had been mentioned.

“Quite  right,”  admitted  the  Professor,  “toadstools  grew 
there. And what else? What do you find underneath trees in 
a wood?”

“Please, sir, earth, sir.”
“No; no; what grows in a wood besides trees?”
“Oh, please, sir, bushes, sir.”
“Bushes;  very  good.  Now  we  are  getting  on.  In  this  wood 

there were trees and bushes. And what else?”

He pointed to a small boy near the bottom, who having de-
cided that the wood was too far off to be of any annoyance to 
him, individually, was occupying his leisure playing noughts 
and crosses against himself. Vexed and bewildered, but feeling 
it necessary to add something to the inventory, he hazarded 
blackberries. This was a mistake; the poet had not mentioned 
blackberries.

“Of  course,  Klobstock  would  think  of  something  to  eat,” 
commented  the  Professor,  who  prided  himself  on  his  ready 
wit.  This  raised  a  laugh  against  Klobstock,  and  pleased  the 
Professor.

— 269 —

“You,” continued he, pointing to a boy in the middle; “what 

else was there in this wood besides trees and bushes?”

“Please, sir, there was a torrent there.”
“Quite right; and what did the torrent do?”
“Please, sir, it gurgled.”
“No; no. Streams gurgle, torrents — ?”
“Roar, sir.”
“It roared. And what made it roar?”
This was a poser. One boy — he was not our prize intellect, 
I admit — suggested the girl. To help us the Professor put his 
question in another form:

“When did it roar?”
Our third boy, again coming to the rescue, explained that it 
roared when it fell down among the rocks. I think some of us 
had a vague idea that it must have been a cowardly torrent to 
make such a noise about a little thing like this; a pluckier tor-
rent, we felt, would have got up and gone on, saying nothing 
about it. A torrent that roared every time it fell upon a rock we 
deemed a poor spirited torrent; but the Professor seemed quite 
content with it.

“And what lived in this wood beside the girl?” was the next 

question.

“Please, sir, birds, sir.”
“Yes, birds lived in this wood. What else?”
Birds seemed to have exhausted our ideas.
“Come,”  said  the  Professor, “what  are  those  animals  with 

tails, that run up trees?”

We thought for a while, then one of us suggested cats.
This  was  an  error;  the  poet  had  said  nothing  about  cats; 

squirrels was what the Professor was trying to get.

I do not recall much more about this wood in detail. I only 
recollect that the sky was introduced into it. In places where 
there occurred an opening among the trees you could by look-
ing up see the sky above you; very often there were clouds in 
this  sky,  and  occasionally,  if  I  remember  rightly,  the  girl  got 
wet.

I have dwelt upon this incident, because it seems to me sug-
gestive of the whole question of scenery in literature. I could 
not at the time, I cannot now, understand why the top boy’s 
summary  was  not  sufficient.  With  all  due  deference  to  the 
poet, whoever he may have been, one cannot but acknowledge 
that his wood was, and could not be otherwise than, “the usual 
sort of a wood.”

I  could  describe  the  Black  Forest  to  you  at  great  length.  I 
could  translate  to  you  Hebel,  the  poet  of  the  Black  Forest.  I 
could  write  pages  concerning  its  rocky  gorges  and  its  smil-
ing valleys, its pine-clad slopes, its rock-crowned summits, its 
foaming rivulets (where the tidy German has not condemned 
them to flow respectably through wooden troughs or drain-
pipes), its white villages, its lonely farmsteads.

But  I  am  haunted  by  the  suspicion  you  might  skip  all 
this.  Were  you  sufficiently  conscientious — or  weak-minded 
enough — not to do so, I should, all said and done, succeed in 
conveying to you only an impression much better summed up 
in the simple words of the unpretentious guide book:

“A picturesque, mountainous district, bounded on the south 
and the west by the plain of the Rhine, towards which its spurs 
descend precipitately. Its geological formation consists chiefly 
of  variegated  sandstone  and  granite;  its  lower  heights  being 
covered with extensive pine forests. It is well watered with nu-
merous streams, while its populous valleys are fertile and well 
cultivated. The inns are good; but the local wines should be 
partaken of by the stranger with discretion.”

WE arrived in Hamburg on Friday after a smooth and unevent-
ful voyage; and from Hamburg we travelled to Berlin by way of 
Hanover. It is not the most direct route. I can only account for 
our visit to Hanover as the nigger accounted to the magistrate 
for his appearance in the Deacon’s poultry-yard.

“Well?”
“Yes, sar, what the constable sez is quite true, sar; I was dar, 

sar.”

“Oh, so you admit it? And what were you doing with a sack, 
pray,  in  Deacon Abraham’s  poultry-yard  at  twelve  o’clock  at 
night?”

“I’se gwine ter tell yer, sar; yes, sar. I’d been to Massa Jordan’s 
wid a sack of melons. Yes, sar; an’ Massa Jordan he wuz very 
’greeable, an’ axed me for ter come in.”

“Yes, sar, very ’greeable man is Massa Jordan. An’ dar we sat 

a talking an’ a talking — ”

“Very likely. What we want to know is what you were doing 

in the Deacon’s poultry-yard?”

“Yes, sar, dat’s what I’se cumming to. It wuz ver’ late ’fore I 
left Massa Jordan’s, an’ den I sez ter mysel’, sez I, now yer jest 
step out with yer best leg foremost, Ulysses, case yer gets into 
trouble  wid  de  ole  woman. Ver’  talkative  woman  she  is,  sar, 
very — ”

“Yes, never mind her; there are other people very talkative 
in this town besides your wife. Deacon Abraham’s house is half 
a mile out of your way home from Mr. Jordan’s. How did you 
get there?”

“Dat’s what I’m a-gwine ter explain, sar.”

— 272 —

“I am glad of that. And how do you propose to do it?”
“Well, I’se thinkin’, sar, I must ha’ digressed.”
I take it we digressed a little.
At first, from some reason or other, Hanover strikes you as 
an uninteresting town, but it grows upon you. It is in reality 
two  towns;  a  place  of  broad,  modern,  handsome  streets  and 
tasteful gardens; side by side with a sixteenth-century town, 
where old timbered houses overhang the narrow lanes; where 
through low archways one catches glimpses of galleried court-
yards, once often thronged, no doubt, with troops of horse, or 
blocked with lumbering coach and six, waiting its rich mer-
chant owner, and his fat placid Frau, but where now children 
and chickens scuttle at their will; while over the carved balco-
nies hang dingy clothes a-drying.

A singularly English atmosphere hovers over Hanover, es-
pecially  on  Sundays,  when  its  shuttered  shops  and  clanging 
bells give to it the suggestion of a sunnier London. Nor was 
this British Sunday atmosphere apparent only to myself, else 
I might have attributed it to imagination; even George felt it. 
Harris and I, returning from a short stroll with our cigars after 
lunch on the Sunday afternoon, found him peacefully slum-
bering in the smoke-room’s easiest chair.

“After all,” said Harris, “there is something about the Brit-
ish Sunday that appeals to the man with English blood in his 
veins. I should be sorry to see it altogether done away with, let 
the new generation say what it will.”

And  taking  one  each  end  of  the  ample  settee,  we  kept 

George company.

To Hanover one should go, they say, to learn the best Ger-
man. The disadvantage is that outside Hanover, which is only 
a small province, nobody understands this best German. Thus 
you have to decide whether to speak good German and remain 
in Hanover, or bad German and travel about. Germany being 
separated  so  many  centuries  into  a  dozen  principalities,  is 
unfortunate in possessing a variety of dialects. Germans from 
Posen wishful to converse with men of Wurtemburg, have to 

— 273 —

talk as often as not in French or English; and young ladies who 
have received an expensive education in Westphalia surprise 
and  disappoint  their  parents  by  being  unable  to  understand 
a  word  said  to  them  in  Mechlenberg.  An  English-speaking 
foreigner,  it  is  true,  would  find  himself  equally  nonplussed 
among the Yorkshire wolds, or in the purlieus of Whitechapel; 
but the cases are not on all fours. Throughout Germany it is 
not only in the country districts and among the uneducated 
that dialects are maintained. Every province has practically its 
own language, of which it is proud and retentive. An educated 
Bavarian  will  admit  to  you  that,  academically  speaking,  the 
North German is more correct; but he will continue to speak 
South German and to teach it to his children.

In  the  course  of  the  century,  I  am  inclined  to  think  that 
Germany will solve her difficulty in this respect by speaking 
English.  Every  boy  and  girl  in  Germany,  above  the  peasant 
class,  speaks  English.  Were  English  pronunciation  less  arbi-
trary, there is not the slightest doubt but that in the course of 
a very few years, comparatively speaking, it would become the 
language of the world. All foreigners agree that, grammatically, 
it is the easiest language of any to learn. A German, compar-
ing it with his own language, where every word in every sen-
tence is governed by at least four distinct and separate rules, 
tells you that English has no grammar. A good many English 
people would seem to have come to the same conclusion; but 
they are wrong. As a matter of fact, there is an English gram-
mar, and one of these days our schools will recognise the fact, 
and it will be taught to our children, penetrating maybe even 
into literary and journalistic circles. But at present we appear 
to  agree  with  the  foreigner  that  it  is  a  quantity  neglectable. 
English pronunciation is the stumbling-block to our progress. 
English spelling would seem to have been designed chiefly as 
a  disguise  to  pronunciation.  It  is  a  clever  idea,  calculated  to 
check presumption on the part of the foreigner; but for that he 
would learn it in a year.

For they have a way of teaching languages in Germany that 

— 274 —

is  not  our  way,  and  the  consequence  is  that  when  the  Ger-
man  youth  or  maiden  leaves  the  gymnasium  or  high  school 
at fifteen, “it” (as in Germany one conveniently may say) can 
understand and speak the tongue it has been learning. In Eng-
land  we  have  a  method  that  for  obtaining  the  least  possible 
result at the greatest possible expenditure of time and money 
is perhaps unequalled. An English boy who has been through a 
good middle-class school in England can talk to a Frenchman, 
slowly and with difficulty, about female gardeners and aunts; 
conversation  which,  to  a  man  possessed  perhaps  of  neither, 
is liable to pall. Possibly, if he be a bright exception, he may 
be able to tell the time, or make a few guarded observations 
concerning  the  weather.  No  doubt  he  could  repeat  a  goodly 
number of irregular verbs by heart; only, as a matter of fact, 
few foreigners care to listen to their own irregular verbs, recit-
ed by young Englishmen. Likewise he might be able to remem-
ber a choice selection of grotesquely involved French idioms, 
such as no modern Frenchman has ever heard or understands 
when he does hear.

The  explanation  is  that,  in  nine  cases  out  of  ten,  he  has 
learnt  French  from  an  “Ahn’s  First-Course.”  The  history  of 
this famous work is remarkable and instructive. The book was 
originally written for a joke, by a witty Frenchman who had 
resided for some years in England. He intended it as a satire 
upon the conversational powers of British society. From this 
point of view it was distinctly good. He submitted it to a Lon-
don publishing firm. The manager was a shrewd man. He read 
the book through. Then he sent for the author.

“This book of yours,” said he to the author, “is very clever. I 

have laughed over it myself till the tears came.”

“I  am  delighted  to  hear  you  say  so,”  replied  the  pleased 
Frenchman. “I tried to be truthful without being unnecessarily 
offensive.”

“It is most amusing,” concurred the manager; “and yet pub-

lished as a harmless joke, I feel it would fail.”

The author’s face fell.

— 275 —

“Its humour,” proceeded the manager, “would be denounced 
as forced and extravagant. It would amuse the thoughtful and 
intelligent, but from a business point of view that portion of 
the  public  are  never  worth  considering.  But  I  have  an  idea,” 
continued  the  manager.  He  glanced  round  the  room  to  be 
sure they were alone, and leaning forward sunk his voice to a 
whisper. “My notion is to publish it as a serious work for the 
use of schools!”

The author stared, speechless.
“I  know  the  English  schoolman,”  said  the  manager; “this 
book will appeal to him. It will exactly fit in with his method. 
Nothing sillier, nothing more useless for the purpose will he 
ever discover. He will smack his lips over the book, as a puppy 
licks up blacking.”

The author, sacrificing art to greed, consented. They altered 
the title and added a vocabulary, but left the book otherwise 
as it was.

The result is known to every schoolboy. “Ahn” became the 
palladium  of  English  philological  education.  If  it  no  longer 
retains its ubiquity, it is because something even less adaptable 
to the object in view has been since invented.

Lest, in spite of all, the British schoolboy should obtain, even 
from the like of “Ahn,” some glimmering of French, the British 
educational method further handicaps him by bestowing upon 
him the assistance of, what is termed in the prospectus, “A na-
tive gentleman.” This native French gentleman, who, by-the-by, 
is generally a Belgian, is no doubt a most worthy person, and 
can,  it  is  true,  understand  and  speak  his  own  language  with 
tolerable fluency. There his qualifications cease. Invariably he 
is a man with a quite remarkable inability to teach anybody 
anything.  Indeed,  he  would  seem  to  be  chosen  not  so  much 
as an instructor as an amuser of youth. He is always a comic 
figure.  No  Frenchman  of  a  dignified  appearance  would  be 
engaged for any English school. If he possess by nature a few 
harmless peculiarities, calculated to cause merriment, so much 
the more is he esteemed by his employers. The class naturally 

— 276 —

regards him as an animated joke. The two to four hours a week 
that are deliberately wasted on this ancient farce, are looked 
forward to by the boys as a merry interlude in an otherwise 
monotonous existence. And then, when the proud parent takes 
his son and heir to Dieppe merely to discover that the lad does 
not know enough to call a cab, he abuses not the system, but 
its innocent victim.

I  confine  my  remarks  to  French,  because  that  is  the  only 
language we attempt to teach our youth. An English boy who 
could speak German would be looked down upon as unpatri-
otic. Why we waste time in teaching even French according to 
this method I have never been able to understand. A perfect 
unacquaintance  with  a  language  is  respectable.  But  putting 
aside  comic  journalists  and  lady  novelists,  for  whom  it  is  a 
business necessity, this smattering of French which we are so 
proud to possess only serves to render us ridiculous.

In  the  German  school  the  method  is  somewhat  different. 
One hour every day is devoted to the same language. The idea 
is not to give the lad time between each lesson to forget what 
he learned at the last; the idea is for him to get on. There is 
no comic foreigner provided for his amusement. The desired 
language is taught by a German school-master who knows it 
inside and out as thoroughly as he knows his own. Maybe this 
system does not provide the German youth with that perfec-
tion of foreign accent for which the British tourist is in every 
land  remarkable,  but  it  has  other  advantages.  The  boy  does 
not call his master “froggy,” or “sausage,” nor prepare for the 
French or English hour any exhibition of homely wit whatever. 
He just sits there, and for his own sake tries to learn that for-
eign tongue with as little trouble to everybody concerned as 
possible. When he has left school he can talk, not about pen-
knives  and  gardeners  and  aunts  merely,  but  about  European 
politics, history, Shakespeare, or the musical glasses, according 
to the turn the conversation may take.

Viewing  the  German  people  from  an Anglo-Saxon  stand-
point, it may be that in this book I shall find occasion to criti-

— 277 —

cise them: but on the other hand there is much that we might 
learn from them; and in the matter of common sense, as ap-
plied to education, they can give us ninety-nine in a hundred 
and beat us with one hand.

The beautiful wood of the Eilenriede bounds Hanover on 
the south and west, and here occurred a sad drama in which 
Harris took a prominent part.

We  were  riding  our  machines  through  this  wood  on  the 
Monday  afternoon  in  the  company  of  many  other  cyclists, 
for  it  is  a  favourite  resort  with  the  Hanoverians  on  a  sunny 
afternoon, and its shady pathways are then filled with happy, 
thoughtless folk. Among them rode a young and beautiful girl 
on a machine that was new. She was evidently a novice on the 
bicycle. One felt instinctively that there would come a moment 
when she would require help, and Harris, with his accustomed 
chivalry, suggested we should keep near her. Harris, as he occa-
sionally explains to George and to myself, has daughters of his 
own, or, to speak more correctly, a daughter, who as the years 
progress will no doubt cease practising catherine wheels in the 
front garden, and will grow up into a beautiful and respect-
able young lady. This naturally gives Harris an interest in all 
beautiful girls up to the age of thirty-five or thereabouts; they 
remind him, so he says, of home.

We had ridden for about two miles, when we noticed, a little 
ahead of us in a space where five ways met, a man with a hose, 
watering the roads. The pipe, supported at each joint by a pair 
of  tiny  wheels,  writhed  after  him  as  he  moved,  suggesting  a 
gigantic-worm, from whose open neck, as the man, gripping it 
firmly in both hands, pointing it now this way, and now that, 
now elevating it, now depressing it, poured a strong stream of 
water at the rate of about a gallon a second.

“What a much better method than ours,” observed Harris, 
enthusiastically. Harris is inclined to be chronically severe on 
all British institutions. “How much simpler, quicker, and more 
economical! You see, one man by this method can in five min-

— 278 —

utes water a stretch of road that would take us with our clumsy 
lumbering cart half an hour to cover.”

George,  who  was  riding  behind  me  on  the  tandem,  said, 
“Yes, and it is also a method by which with a little carelessness 
a man could cover a good many people in a good deal less time 
than they could get out of the way.”

George, the opposite to Harris, is British to the core. I re-
member George quite patriotically indignant with Harris once 
for suggesting the introduction of the guillotine into England.

“It is so much neater,” said Harris.
“I don’t care if it is,” said George; “I’m an Englishman; hang-

ing is good enough for me.”

“Our  water-cart  may  have  its  disadvantages,”  continued 
George, “but  it  can  only  make  you  uncomfortable  about  the 
legs,  and  you  can  avoid  it.  This  is  the  sort  of  machine  with 
which a man can follow you round the corner and upstairs.”

“It fascinates me to watch them,” said Harris. “They are so 
skilful. I have seen a man from the corner of a crowded square 
in  Strassburg  cover  every  inch  of  ground,  and  not  so  much 
as wet an apron string. It is marvellous how they judge their 
distance. They will send the water up to your toes, and then 
bring it over your head so that it falls around your heels. They 
can —”

“Ease up a minute,” said George. I said: “Why?”
He  said: “I  am  going  to  get  off  and  watch  the  rest  of  this 
show  from  behind  a  tree.  There  may  be  great  performers  in 
this line, as Harris says; this particular artist appears to me to 
lack something. He has just soused a dog, and now he’s busy 
watering a sign-post. I am going to wait till he has finished.”

“Nonsense,” said Harris; “he won’t wet you.”
“That  is  precisely  what  I  am  going  to  make  sure  of,”  an-
swered George, saying which he jumped off, and, taking up a 
position behind a remarkably fine elm, pulled out and com-
menced filling his pipe.

I did not care to take the tandem on by myself, so I stepped 
off and joined him, leaving the machine against a tree. Harris 

— 279 —

shouted something or other about our being a disgrace to the 
land that gave us birth, and rode on.

The next moment I heard a woman’s cry of distress. Glanc-
ing round the stem of the tree, I perceived that it proceeded 
from the young and elegant lady before mentioned, whom, in 
our  interest  concerning  the  road-waterer,  we  had  forgotten. 
She was riding her machine steadily and straightly through a 
drenching shower of water from the hose. She appeared to be 
too paralysed either to get off or turn her wheel aside. Every 
instant she was becoming wetter, while the man with the hose, 
who was either drunk or blind, continued to pour water upon 
her with utter indifference. A dozen voices yelled imprecations 
upon him, but he took no heed whatever.

Harris, his fatherly nature stirred to its depths, did at this 
point what, under the circumstances, was quite the right and 
proper  thing  to  do.  Had  he  acted  throughout  with  the  same 
coolness  and  judgment  he  then  displayed,  he  would  have 
emerged from that incident the hero of the hour, instead of, as 
happened, riding away followed by insult and threat. Without 
a  moment’s  hesitation  he  spurted  at  the  man,  sprang  to  the 
ground, and, seizing the hose by the nozzle, attempted to wrest 
it away.

What  he  ought  to  have  done,  what  any  man  retaining  his 
common sense would have done the moment he got his hands 
upon the thing, was to turn off the tap. Then he might have 
played foot-ball with the man, or battledore and shuttlecock 
as he pleased; and the twenty or thirty people who had rushed 
forward to assist would have only applauded. His idea, how-
ever,  as  he  explained  to  us  afterwards,  was  to  take  away  the 
hose from the man, and, for punishment, turn it upon the fool 
himself. The waterman’s idea appeared to be the same, namely, 
to retain the hose as a weapon with which to soak Harris. Of 
course, the result was that, between them, they soused every 
dead  and  living  thing  within  fifty  yards,  except  themselves. 
One furious man, too drenched to care what more happened 
to him, leapt into the arena and also took a hand. The three 

— 280 —

among them proceeded to sweep the compass with that hose. 
They pointed it to heaven, and the water descended upon the 
people  in  the  form  of  an  equinoctial  storm.  They  pointed  it 
downwards, and sent the water in rushing streams that took 
people off their feet, or caught them about the waist line, and 
doubled them up.

Not one of them would loosen his grip upon the hose, not 
one  of  them  thought  to  turn  the  water  off. You  might  have 
concluded they were struggling with some primeval force of 
nature. In forty-five seconds, so George said, who was timing 
it, they had swept that circus bare of every living thing except 
one dog, who, dripping like a water nymph, rolled over by the 
force  of  water,  now  on  this  side,  now  on  that,  still  gallantly 
staggered again and again to its feet to bark defiance at what it 
evidently regarded as the powers of hell let loose.

Men and women left their machines upon the ground, and 
flew  into  the  woods.  From  behind  every  tree  of  importance 
peeped out wet, angry heads.

At last, there arrived upon the scene one man of sense. Brav-
ing all things, he crept to the hydrant, where still stood the iron 
key, and screwed it down. And then from forty trees began to 
creep more or less soaked human beings, each one with some-
thing to say.

At first I fell to wondering whether a stretcher or a clothes 
basket would be the more useful for the conveyance of Harris’s 
remains back to the hotel. I consider that George’s promptness 
on that occasion saved Harris’s life. Being dry, and therefore 
able to run quicker, he was there before the crowd. Harris was 
for explaining things, but George cut him short.

“You get on that,” said George, handing him his bicycle, “and 
go. They don’t know we belong to you, and you may trust us 
implicitly not to reveal the secret. We’ll hang about behind, and 
get in their way. Ride zig-zag in case they shoot.”

I wish this book to be a strict record of fact, unmarred by ex-
aggeration, and therefore I have shown my description of this 
incident  to  Harris,  lest  anything  beyond  bald  narrative  may 

— 281 —

have crept into it. Harris maintains it is exaggerated, but ad-
mits that one or two people may have been “sprinkled.” I have 
offered to turn a street hose on him at a distance of five-and-
twenty yards, and take his opinion afterwards, as to whether 
“sprinkled” is the adequate term, but he has declined the test. 
Again, he insists there could not have been more than half a 
dozen people, at the outside, involved in the catastrophe, that 
forty is a ridiculous misstatement. I have offered to return with 
him to Hanover and make strict inquiry into the matter, and 
this offer he has likewise declined. Under these circumstances, 
I maintain that mine is a true and restrained narrative of an 
event  that  is,  by  a  certain  number  of  Hanoverians,  remem-
bered with bitterness unto this very day.

We left Hanover that same evening, and arrived at Berlin in 
time for supper and an evening stroll. Berlin is a disappoint-
ing town; its centre over-crowded, its outlying parts lifeless; its 
one famous street, Unter den Linden, an attempt to combine 
Oxford Street with the Champs Elysée, singularly unimposing, 
being much too wide for its size; its theatres dainty and charm-
ing, where acting is considered of more importance than scen-
ery or dress, where long runs are unknown, successful pieces 
being played again and again, but never consecutively, so that 
for a week running you may go to the same Berlin theatre, and 
see a fresh play every night; its opera house unworthy of it; 
its two music halls, with an unnecessary suggestion of vulgar-
ity and commonness about them, ill-arranged and much too 
large for comfort. In the Berlin cafés and restaurants, the busy 
time is from midnight on till three. Yet most of the people who 
frequent them are up again at seven. Either the Berliner has 
solved the great problem of modern life, how to do without 
sleep, or, with Carlyle, he must be looking forward to eternity.
Personally, I know of no other town where such late hours 
are the vogue, except St. Petersburg. But your St. Petersburger 
does  not  get  up  early  in  the  morning. At  St.  Petersburg,  the 
music  halls,  which  it  is  the  fashionable  thing  to  attend  after 
the  theatre — a  drive  to  them  taking  half  an  hour  in  a  swift 

— 282 —

sleigh — do not practically begin till twelve. Through the Neva 
at four o’clock in the morning you have to literally push your 
way;  and  the  favourite  trains  for  travellers  are  those  start-
ing  about  five  o’clock  in  the  morning.  These  trains  save  the 
Russian the trouble of getting up early. He wishes his friends 
“Good-night,” and drives down to the station comfortably af-
ter supper, without putting the house to any inconvenience.

Potsdam, the Versailles to Berlin, is a beautiful little town, 
situate among lakes and woods. Here in the shady ways of its 
quiet, far-stretching park of Sans Souci, it is easy to imagine 
lean, snuffy Frederick “bummeling” with shrill Voltaire.

Acting on my advice, George and Harris consented not to 
stay long in Berlin; but to push on to Dresden. Most that Ber-
lin has to show can be seen better elsewhere, and we decided 
to be content with a drive through the town. The hotel porter 
introduced us to a droschke driver, under whose guidance, so 
he assured us, we should see everything worth seeing in the 
shortest possible time. The man himself, who called for us at 
nine o’clock in the morning, was all that could be desired. He 
was  bright,  intelligent,  and  well-informed;  his  German  was 
easy to understand, and he knew a little English with which to 
eke it out on occasion. With the man himself there was no fault 
to be found, but his horse was the most unsympathetic brute I 
have ever sat behind.

He took a dislike to us the moment he saw us. I was the first 
to come out of the hotel. He turned his head, and looked me 
up and down with a cold, glassy eye; and then he looked across 
at another horse, a friend of his that was standing facing him. 
I knew what he said. He had an expressive head, and he made 
no attempt to disguise his thought.

He said:
“Funny things one does come across in the summer time, 

don’t one?”

George followed me out the next moment, and stood behind 
me. The horse again turned his head and looked. I have never 
known a horse that could twist himself as this horse did. I have 

— 283 —

seen a camelopard do trick’s with his neck that compelled one’s 
attention, but this animal was more like the thing one dreams 
of after a dusty days at Ascot, followed by a dinner with six 
old chums. If I had seen his eyes looking at me from between 
his own hind legs, I doubt if I should have been surprised. He 
seemed more amused with George if anything, than with my-
self. He turned to his friend again.

“Extraordinary,  isn’t  it?”  he  remarked;  “I  suppose  there 
must  be  some  place  where  they  grow  them”;  and  then  he 
commenced licking flies off his own left shoulder. I began to 
wonder whether he had lost his mother when young, and had 
been brought up by a cat.

George  and  I  climbed  in,  and  sat  waiting  for  Harris.  He 
came a moment later. Myself, I thought he looked rather neat. 
He wore a white flannel knickerbocker suit, which he had had 
made specially for bicycling in hot weather; his hat may have 
been a trifle out of the common, but it did keep the sun off.

The horse gave one look at him, said “Gott in Himmel!” as 
plainly  as  ever  horse  spoke,  and  started  off  down  Friedrich 
Strasse at a brisk walk, leaving Harris and the driver standing 
on the pavement. His owner called to him to stop, but he took 
no notice. They ran after us, and overtook us at the corner of 
the Dorotheen Strasse. I could not catch what the man said to 
the horse, he spoke quickly and excitedly; but I gathered a few 
phrases, such as:

“Got to earn my living somehow, haven’t I? Who asked for 

your opinion? Aye, little you care so long as you can guzzle.”

The horse cut the conversation short by turning up the Dor-
otheen Strasse on his own account. I think what he said was:

“Come on then; don’t talk so much. Let’s get the job over, 

and, where possible, let’s keep to the back streets.”

Opposite  the  Brandenburger  Thor  our  driver  hitched  the 
reins to the whip, climbed down, and came round to explain 
things to us. He pointed out the Thiergarten, and then descant-
ed to us of the Reichstag House. He informed us of its exact 
height, length, and breadth, after the manner of guides. Then 

— 284 —

he turned his attention to the Gate. He said it was constructed 
of sandstone, in imitation of the “Properleer” in Athens.

At this point the horse, which had been occupying its leisure 
licking its own legs, turned round its head. It did not say any-
thing, it just looked.

The man began again nervously. This time he said it was an 

imitation of the “Propeyedliar.”

Here the horse proceeded up the Linden, and nothing would 
persuade him not to proceed up the Linden. His owner expos-
tulated with him, but he continued to trot on. From the way 
he hitched his shoulders as he moved, I somehow felt he was 
saying:

“They’ve  seen  the  Gate,  haven’  t  they?  Very  well,  that’s 
enough. As for the rest, you don’t know what you are talking 
about, and they wouldn’t understand you if you did. You talk 
German.”

It was the same throughout the length of the Linden. The 
horse consented to stand still sufficiently long to enable us to 
have a good look at each sight, and to hear the name of it. All 
explanation and description he cut short by the simple process 
of moving on.

“What these fellows want,” he seemed to say to himself, “is 
to go home and tell people they have seen these things. If I am 
doing them an injustice, if they are more intelligent than they 
look, they can get better information than this old fool of mine 
is giving them from the guide book. Who wants to know how 
high a steeple is? You don’t remember it the next five minutes 
when  you  are  told,  and  if  you  do  it  is  because  you  have  got 
nothing else in your head. He just tires me with his talk. Why 
doesn’t he hurry up, and let us all get home to lunch?”

Upon  reflection,  I  am  not  sure  that  wall-eyed  old  brute 
had  not  sense  on  its  side.  Anyhow,  I  know  there  have  been 
occasions,  with  a  guide,  when  I  would  have  been  glad  of  its 
interference.

But one is apt to “sin one’s mercies,” as the Scotch say, and at 

the time we cursed that horse instead of blessing it.

entertainment — It  is  unappreciated — George  and  the  aunt  of 

him — George, a cushion, and three damsels.

AT a point between Berlin and Dresden, George, who had, for 
the last quarter of an hour or so, been looking very attentively 
out of the window, said:

“Why, in Germany, is it the custom to put the letter-box up a 
tree? Why do they not fix it to the front door as we do? I should 
hate having to climb up a tree to get my letters. Besides, it is 
not fair to the postman. In addition to being most exhausting, 
the delivery of letters must to a heavy man, on windy nights, be 
positively dangerous work. If they will fix it to a tree, why not 
fix it lower down, why always among the topmost branches? 
But,  maybe,  I  am  misjudging  the  country,”  he  continued,  a 
new idea occurring to him. “Possibly the Germans, who are in 
many matters ahead of us, have perfected a pigeon post. Even 
so, I cannot help thinking they would have been wiser to train 
the birds, while they were about it, to deliver the letters nearer 
the  ground.  Getting  your  letters  out  of  those  boxes  must  be 
tricky work even to the average middle-aged German.”

I followed his gaze out of window. I said:
“Those are not letter-boxes, they are birds’ nests. You must 
understand this nation. The German loves birds, but he likes 
tidy birds. A bird left to himself builds his nest just anywhere. 
It  is  not  a  pretty  object,  according  to  the  German  notion  of 
prettiness.  There  is  not  a  bit  of  paint  on  it  anywhere,  not  a 
plaster image all round, not even a flag. The nest finished, the 
bird proceeds to live outside it. He drops things on the grass; 
twigs, ends of worms, all sorts of things. He is indelicate. He 
makes love, quarrels with his wife, and feeds the children quite 

— 286 —

in public. The German householder is shocked. He says to the 
bird:

“‘For many things I like you. I like to look at you. I like to 
hear you sing. But I don’t like your ways. Take this little box, 
and  put  your  rubbish  inside  where  I  can’t  see  it.  Come  out 
when you want to sing; but let your domestic arrangements be 
confined to the interior. Keep to the box, and don’t make the 
garden untidy.’”

In  Germany  one  breathes  in  love  of  order  with  the  air, 
in  Germany  the  babies  beat  time  with  their  rattles,  and  the 
German bird has come to prefer the box, and to regard with 
contempt the few uncivilised outcasts who continue to build 
their nests in trees and hedges. In course of time every Ger-
man bird, one is confident, will have his proper place in a full 
chorus. This promiscuous and desultory warbling of his must, 
one  feels,  be  irritating  to  the  precise  German  mind;  there  is 
no method in it. The music-loving German will organise him. 
Some stout bird with a specially well-developed crop will be 
trained to conduct him, and, instead of wasting himself in a 
wood at four o’clock in the morning, he will, at the advertised 
time, sing in a beer garden, accompanied by a piano. Things 
are drifting that way.

Your German likes nature, but his idea of nature is a glo-
rified Welsh  Harp.  He  takes  great  interest  in  his  garden.  He 
plants  seven  rose  trees  on  the  north  side  and  seven  on  the 
south, and if they do not grow up all the same size and shape it 
worries him so that he cannot sleep of nights. Every flower he 
ties to a stick. This interferes with his view of the flower, but he 
has the satisfaction of knowing it is there, and that it is behav-
ing itself. The lake is lined with zinc, and once a week he takes 
it up, carries it into the kitchen, and scours it. In the geometri-
cal centre of the grass plot, which is sometimes as large as a 
tablecloth and is generally railed round, he places a china dog. 
The Germans are very fond of dogs, but as a rule they prefer 
them of china. The china dog never digs holes in the lawn to 
bury bones, and never scatters a flower-bed to the winds with 

— 287 —

his hind legs. From the German point of view, he is the ideal 
dog. He stops where you put him, and he is never where you 
do not want him. You can have him perfect in all points, ac-
cording to the latest requirements of the Kennel Club; or you 
can indulge your own fancy and have something unique. You 
are not, as with other dogs, limited to breed. In china, you can 
have a blue dog or a pink dog. For a little extra, you can have a 
double-headed dog.

On a certain fixed date in the autumn the German stakes 
his  flowers  and  bushes  to  the  earth,  and  covers  them  with 
Chinese matting; and on a certain fixed date in the spring he 
uncovers them, and stands them up again. If it happens to be 
an exceptionally fine autumn, or an exceptionally late spring, 
so much the worse for the unfortunate vegetable. No true Ger-
man  would  allow  his  arrangements  to  be  interfered  with  by 
so unruly a thing as the solar system. Unable to regulate the 
weather, he ignores it.

Among trees, your German’s favourite is the poplar. Other 
disorderly nations may sing the charms of the rugged oak, the 
spreading chestnut, or the waving elm. To the German all such, 
with their wilful, untidy ways, are eyesores. The poplar grows 
where it is planted, and how it is planted. It has no improper 
rugged ideas of its own. It does not want to wave or to spread 
itself.  It  just  grows  straight  and  upright  as  a  German  tree 
should grow; and so gradually the German is rooting out all 
other trees, and replacing them with poplars.

Your German likes the country, but he prefers it as the lady 
thought she would the noble savage — more dressed. He likes 
his walk through the wood — to a restaurant. But the pathway 
must  not  be  too  steep,  it  must  have  a  brick  gutter  running 
down one side of it to drain it, and every twenty yards or so it 
must have its seat on which he can rest and mop his brow; for 
your German would no more think of sitting on the grass than 
would an English bishop dream of rolling down One Tree Hill. 
He likes his view from the summit of the hill, but he likes to 
find there a stone tablet telling him what to look at, find a table 

— 288 —

and bench at which he can sit to partake of the frugal beer and 
“belegte Semmel” he has been careful to bring with him. If, in 
addition, he can find a police notice posted on a tree, forbid-
ding  him  to  do  something  or  other,  that  gives  him  an  extra 
sense of comfort and security.

Your German is not averse even to wild scenery, provided it 
be not too wild. But if he consider it too savage, he sets to work 
to  tame  it.  I  remember,  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Dresden, 
discovering  a  picturesque  and  narrow  valley  leading  down 
towards the Elbe. The winding roadway ran beside a moun-
tain torrent, which for a mile or so fretted and foamed over 
rocks and boulders between wood-covered banks. I followed 
it enchanted until, turning a corner, I suddenly came across a 
gang of eighty or a hundred workmen. They were busy tidy-
ing up that valley, and making that stream respectable. All the 
stones that were impeding the course of the water they were 
carefully  picking  out  and  carting  away.  The  bank  on  either 
side they were bricking up and cementing. The overhanging 
trees  and  bushes,  the  tangled  vines  and  creepers  they  were 
rooting up and trimming down. A little further I came upon 
the finished work — the mountain valley as it ought to be, ac-
cording  to  German  ideas.  The  water,  now  a  broad,  sluggish 
stream,  flowed  over  a  level,  gravelly  bed,  between  two  walls 
crowned with stone coping. At every hundred yards it gently 
descended down three shallow wooden platforms. For a space 
on either side the ground had been cleared, and at regular in-
tervals young poplars planted. Each sapling was protected by a 
shield of wickerwork and bossed by an iron rod. In the course 
of a couple of years it is the hope of the local council to have 
“finished” that valley throughout its entire length, and made it 
fit for a tidy-minded lover of German nature to walk in. There 
will be a seat every fifty yards, a police notice every hundred, 
and a restaurant every half-mile.

They are doing the same from the Memel to the Rhine. They 
are just tidying up the country. I remember well the Wehrthal. 
It was once the most romantic ravine to be found in the Black 

— 289 —

Forest. The last time I walked down it some hundreds of Ital-
ian workmen were encamped there hard at work, training the 
wild little Wehr the way it should go, bricking the banks for it 
here, blasting the rocks for it there, making cement steps for it 
down which it can travel soberly and without fuss.

For in Germany there is no nonsense talked about untram-
melled nature. In Germany nature has got to behave herself, 
and  not  set  a  bad  example  to  the  children. A  German  poet, 
noticing waters coming down as Southey describes, somewhat 
inexactly,  the  waters  coming  down  at  Lodore,  would  be  too 
shocked  to  stop  and  write  alliterative  verse  about  them.  He 
would hurry away, and at once report them to the police. Then 
their foaming and their shrieking would be of short duration.
“Now  then,  now  then,  what’s  all  this  about?”  the  voice  of 
German authority would say severely to the waters. “We can’t 
have  this  sort  of  thing,  you  know.  Come  down  quietly,  can’t 
you? Where do you think you are?”

And the local German council would provide those waters 
with  zinc  pipes  and  wooden  troughs,  and  a  corkscrew  stair-
case, and show them how to come down sensibly, in the Ger-
man manner.

It is a tidy land is Germany.
We reached Dresden on the Wednesday evening, and stayed 

there over the Sunday.

Taking  one  consideration  with  another,  Dresden,  perhaps, 
is the most attractive town in Germany; but it is a place to be 
lived in for a while rather than visited. Its museums and galler-
ies, its palaces and gardens, its beautiful and historically rich 
environment, provide pleasure for a winter, but bewilder for a 
week. It has not the gaiety of Paris or Vienna, which quickly 
palls; its charms are more solidly German, and more lasting. It 
is the Mecca of the musician. For five shillings, in Dresden, you 
can purchase a stall at the opera house, together, unfortunately, 
with a strong disinclination ever again to take the trouble of 
sitting out a performance in any English, French, or, American 
opera house.

— 290 —

The chief scandal of Dresden still centres round August the 
Strong, “the Man of Sin,” as Carlyle always called him, who is 
popularly reputed to have cursed Europe with over a thousand 
children. Castles where he imprisoned this discarded mistress 
or that — one of them, who persisted in her claim to a better 
title, for forty years, it is said, poor lady! The narrow rooms 
where she ate her heart out and died are still shown. Châteaux, 
shameful for this deed of infamy or that, lie scattered round 
the neighbourhood like bones about a battlefield; and most of 
your guide’s stories are such as the “young person” educated 
in Germany had best not hear. His life-sized portrait hangs in 
the fine Zwinger, which he built as an arena for his wild beast 
fights when the people grew tired of them in the market-place; 
a beetle-browed, frankly animal man, but with the culture and 
taste that so often wait upon animalism. Modern Dresden un-
doubtedly owes much to him.

But what the stranger in Dresden stares at most is, perhaps, 
its electric trams. These huge vehicles flash through the streets 
at from ten to twenty miles an hour, taking curves and corners 
after the manner of an Irish car driver. Everybody travels by 
them, excepting only officers in uniform, who must not. La-
dies in evening dress, going to ball or opera, porters with their 
baskets, sit side by side. They are all-important in the streets, 
and everything and everybody makes haste to get out of their 
way. If you do not get out of their way, and you still happen to 
be alive when picked up, then on your recovery you are fined 
for having been in their way. This teaches you to be wary of 
them.

One afternoon Harris took a “bummel” by himself. In the 
evening, as we sat listening to the band at the Belvedere, Harris 
said, a propos of nothing in particular, “These Germans have 
no sense of humour.”

“What makes you think that?” I asked.
“Why,  this  afternoon,”  he  answered, “I  jumped  on  one  of 
those electric tramcars. I wanted to see the town, so I stood 
outside on the little platform — what do you call it?”

— 291 —

“The Stehplatz,” I suggested.
“That’s it,” said Harris. “Well, you know the way they shake 
you about, and how you have to look out for the corners, and 
mind yourself when they stop and when they start?”

I nodded.
“There  were  about  half  a  dozen  of  us  standing  there,”  he 
continued, “and,  of  course,  I  am  not  experienced.  The  thing 
started suddenly, and that jerked me backwards. I fell against 
a  stout  gentleman,  just  behind  me.  He  could  not  have  been 
standing  very  firmly  himself,  and  he,  in  his  turn,  fell  back 
against  a  boy  who  was  carrying  a  trumpet  in  a  green  baize 
case. They never smiled, neither the man nor the boy with the 
trumpet; they just stood there and looked sulky. I was going to 
say I was sorry, but before I could get the words out the tram 
eased up, for some reason or other, and that, of course, shot 
me forward again, and I butted into a white-haired old chap, 
who looked to me like a professor. Well, he never smiled, never 
moved a muscle.”

“Maybe, he was thinking of something else,” I suggested.
“That could not have been the case with them all,” replied 
Harris, “and in the course of that journey, I must have fallen 
against  every  one  of  them  at  least  three  times. You  see,”  ex-
plained  Harris, “they  knew  when  the  corners  were  coming, 
and  in  which  direction  to  brace  themselves.  I,  as  a  stranger, 
was naturally at a disadvantage. The way I rolled and staggered 
about that platform, clutching wildly now at this man and now 
at that, must have been really comic. I don’t say it was high-
class humour, but it would have amused most people. Those 
Germans seemed to see no fun in it whatever — just seemed 
anxious,  that  was  all.  There  was  one  man,  a  little  man,  who 
stood with his back against the brake; I fell against him five 
times, I counted them. You would have expected the fifth time 
would have dragged a laugh out of him, but it didn’t; he merely 
looked tired. They are a dull lot.”

George also had an adventure at Dresden. There was a shop 
near  the  Altmarkt,  in  the  window  of  which  were  exhibited 

— 292 —

some cushions for sale. The proper business of the shop was 
handling of glass and china; the cushions appeared to be in the 
nature of an experiment. They were very beautiful cushions, 
hand-embroidered  on  satin.  We  often  passed  the  shop,  and 
every time George paused and examined those cushions. He 
said he thought his aunt would like one.

George has been very attentive to this aunt of his during the 
journey. He has written her quite a long letter every day, and 
from every town we stop at he sends her off a present. To my 
mind, he is overdoing the business, and more than once I have 
expostulated with him. His aunt will be meeting other aunts, 
and talking to them; the whole class will become disorganised 
and unruly. As a nephew, I object to the impossible standard 
that George is setting up. But he will not listen.

Therefore it was that on the Saturday he left us after lunch, 
saying he would go round to that shop and get one of those 
cushions for his aunt. He said he would not be long, and sug-
gested our waiting for him.

We waited for what seemed to me rather a long time. When 
he rejoined us he was empty handed, and looked worried. We 
asked him where his cushion was. He said he hadn’t got a cush-
ion, said he had changed his mind, said he didn’t think his aunt 
would care for a cushion. Evidently something was amiss. We 
tried to get at the bottom of it, but he was not communicative. 
Indeed,  his  answers  after  our  twentieth  question  or  therea-
bouts became quite short.

In  the  evening,  however,  when  he  and  I  happened  to  be 

alone, he broached the subject himself. He said:

“They  are  somewhat  peculiar  in  some  things,  these  Ger-

mans.”

I said: “What has happened?”
“Well,” he answered, “there was that cushion I wanted.”
“For your aunt,” I remarked.
“Why not?” he returned. He was huffy in a moment; I never 
knew a man so touchy about an aunt. “Why shouldn’t I send a 
cushion to my aunt?”

— 293 —

“Don’t get excited,” I replied. “I am not objecting; I respect 

you for it.”

He recovered his temper, and went on:
“There were four in the window, if you remember, all very 
much  alike,  and  each  one  labelled  in  plain  figures  twenty 
marks. I don’t pretend to speak German fluently, but I can gen-
erally make myself understood with a little effort, and gather 
the  sense  of  what  is  said  to  me,  provided  they  don’t  gabble. 
I went into the shop. A young girl came up to me; she was a 
pretty, quiet little soul, one might almost say, demure; not at 
all the sort of girl from whom you would have expected such a 
thing. I was never more surprised in all my life.”

“Surprised about what?” I said.
George always assumes you know the end of the story while 

he is telling you the beginning; it is an annoying method.

“At what happened,” replied George; “at what I am telling 
you. She smiled and asked me what I wanted. I understood that 
all right; there could have been no mistake about that. I put 
down a twenty mark piece on the counter and said:

“‘Please give me a cushion.’”
“She  stared  at  me  as  if  I  had  asked  for  a  feather  bed.  I 
thought, maybe, she had not heard, so I repeated it louder. If 
I had chucked her under the chin she could not have looked 
more surprised or indignant.

“She said she thought I must be making a mistake.
“I did not want to begin a long conversation and find myself 
stranded. I said there was no mistake. I pointed to my twenty 
mark  piece,  and  repeated  for  the  third  time  that  I  wanted  a 
cushion, ‘a twenty mark cushion.’

“Another girl came up, an elder girl; and the first girl repeat-
ed to her what I had just said: she seemed quite excited about 
it. The second girl did not believe her — did not think I looked 
the sort of man who would want a cushion. To make sure, she 
put the question to me herself.

“‘Did you say you wanted a cushion?’ she asked.

— 294 —

“‘I have said it three times,’ I answered. ‘I will say it again — I 

want a cushion.’

“She said: ‘Then you can’t have one.’
“I was getting angry by this time. If I hadn’t really wanted 
the thing I should have walked out of the shop; but there the 
cushions  were  in  the  window,  evidently  for  sale.  I  didn’t  see 
why I couldn’t have one.

“I said: ‘I will have one!’ It is a simple sentence. I said it with 

determination.

“A third girl came up at this point, the three representing, 
I  fancy,  the  whole  force  of  the  shop.  She  was  a  bright-eyed, 
saucy-looking little wench, this last one. On any other occa-
sion I might have been pleased to see her; now, her coming 
only irritated me. I didn’t see the need of three girls for this 
business.

“The first two girls started explaining the thing to the third 
girl, and before they were half-way through the third girl be-
gan  to  giggle — she  was  the  sort  of  girl  who  would  giggle  at 
anything. That done, they fell to chattering like Jenny Wrens, 
all three together; and between every half-dozen words they 
looked across at me; and the more they looked at me the more 
the third girl giggled; and before they had finished they were 
all  three  giggling,  the  little  idiots;  you  might  have  thought  I 
was a clown, giving a private performance.

“When she was steady enough to move, the third girl came 

up to me; she was still giggling. She said:

“‘If you get it, will you go?’
“I did not quite understand her at first, and she repeated it.
“‘This cushion. When you’ve got it, will you go — away — at 

once?’

“I was only too anxious to go. I told her so. But, I added I 
was not going without it. I had made up my mind to have that 
cushion now if I stopped in the shop all night for it.

“She rejoined the other two girls. I thought they were going 
to get me the cushion and have done with the business. Instead 
of that, the strangest thing possible happened. The two other 

— 295 —

girls  got  behind  the  first  girl,  all  three  still  giggling,  Heaven 
knows what about, and pushed her towards me. They pushed 
her close up to me, and then, before I knew what was happen-
ing, she put her hands on my shoulders, stood up on tiptoe, 
and kissed me. After which, burying her face in her apron, she 
ran off, followed by the second girl. The third girl opened the 
door for me, and so evidently expected me to go, that in my 
confusion I went, leaving my twenty marks behind me. I don’t 
say  I  minded  the  kiss,  though  I  did  not  particularly  want  it, 
while I did want the cushion. I don’t like to go back to the shop. 
I cannot understand the thing at all.”

I said: “What did you ask for?”
He said: “A cushion”
I said: “That is what you wanted, I know. What I mean is, 

what was the actual German word you said.”

He replied: “A kuss.”
I  said: “You  have  nothing  to  complain  of.  It  is  somewhat 
confusing. A ‘kuss’ sounds as if it ought to be a cushion, but it 
is not; it is a kiss, while a ‘kissen’ is a cushion. You muddled up 
the two words — people have done it before. I don’t know much 
about  this  sort  of  thing  myself;  but  you  asked  for  a  twenty 
mark kiss, and from your description of the girl some people 
might consider the price reasonable. Anyhow, I should not tell 
Harris. If I remember rightly, he also has an aunt.”
George agreed with me it would be better not.

WE were on our way to Prague, and were waiting in the great 
hall  of  the  Dresden  Station  until  such  time  as  the  powers-
that-be should permit us on to the platform. George, who had 
wandered to the bookstall, returned to us with a wild look in 
his eyes. He said:
“I’ve seen it.”
I said, “Seen what?”
He was too excited to answer intelligently. He said
“It’s  here.  It’s  coming  this  way,  both  of  them.  If  you  wait, 

you’ll see it for yourselves. I’m not joking; it’s the real thing.”

As is usual about this period, some paragraphs, more or less 
serious, had been appearing in the papers concerning the sea-
serpent, and I thought for the moment he must be referring to 
this. A moment’s reflection, however, told me that here, in the 
middle of Europe, three hundred miles from the coast, such a 
thing was impossible. Before I could question him further, he 
seized me by the arm.

“Look!” he said; “now am I exaggerating?”
I turned my head and saw what, I suppose, few living Eng-
lishmen  have  ever  seen  before — the  travelling  Britisher  ac-
cording to the Continental idea, accompanied by his daughter. 
They were coming towards us in the flesh and blood, unless 
we  were  dreaming,  alive  and  concrete — the  English “Milor” 
and  the  English  “Mees,”  as  for  generations  they  have  been 
portrayed in the Continental comic press and upon the Con-
tinental stage. They were perfect in every detail. The man was 
tall and thin, with sandy hair, a huge nose, and long Dundreary 
whiskers. Over a pepper-and-salt suit he wore a light overcoat, 

— 297 —

reaching almost to his heels. His white helmet was ornamented 
with a green veil; a pair of opera-glasses hung at his side, and in 
his lavender-gloved hand he carried an alpenstock a little taller 
than  himself.  His  daughter  was  long  and  angular.  Her  dress 
I  cannot  describe:  my  grandfather,  poor  gentleman,  might 
have been able to do so; it would have been more familiar to 
him. I can only say that it appeared to me unnecessarily short, 
exhibiting a pair of ankles — if I may be permitted to refer to 
such points — that, from an artistic point of view, called rather 
for concealment. Her hat made me think of Mrs. Hemans; but 
why I cannot explain. She wore side-spring boots — “prunella,” 
I believe, used to be the trade name — mittens, and pince-nez. 
She also carried an alpenstock (there is not a mountain within 
a hundred miles of Dresden) and a black bag strapped to her 
waist. Her teeth stuck out like a rabbit’s, and her figure was that 
of a bolster on stilts.

Harris rushed for his camera, and of course could not find 
it;  he  never  can  when  he  wants  it. Whenever  we  see  Harris 
scuttling up and down like a lost dog, shouting, “Where’s my 
camera? What the dickens have I done with my camera? Don’t 
either of you remember where I put my camera?” — then we 
know that for the first time that day he has come across some-
thing worth photographing. Later on, he remembered it was in 
his bag; that is where it would be on an occasion like this.

They  were  not  content  with  appearance;  they  acted  the 
thing to the letter. They walked gaping round them at every 
step. The gentleman had an open Baedeker in his hand, and the 
lady carried a phrase book. They talked French that nobody 
could understand, and German that they could not translate 
themselves! The man poked at officials with his alpenstock to 
attract their attention, and the lady, her eye catching sight of 
an advertisement of somebody’s cocoa, said “Shocking!” and 
turned the other way.

Really, there was some excuse for her. One notices, even in 
England, the home of the proprieties, that the lady who drinks 
cocoa  appears,  according  to  the  poster,  to  require  very  little 

— 298 —

else in this world; a yard or so of art muslin at the most. On the 
Continent she dispenses, so far as one can judge, with every 
other necessity of life. Not only is cocoa food and drink to her, 
it  should  be  clothes  also,  according  to  the  idea  of  the  cocoa 
manufacturer. But this by the way.

Of  course,  they  immediately  became  the  centre  of  attrac-
tion.  By  being  able  to  render  them  some  slight  assistance,  I 
gained the advantage of five minutes’ conversation with them. 
They were very affable. The gentleman told me his name was 
Jones, and that he came from Manchester, but he did not seem 
to know what part of Manchester, or where Manchester was. 
I asked him where he was going to, but he evidently did not 
know.  He  said  it  depended.  I  asked  him  if  he  did  not  find 
an  alpenstock  a  clumsy  thing  to  walk  about  with  through  a 
crowded town; he admitted that occasionally it did get in the 
way.  I  asked  him  if  he  did  not  find  a  veil  interfere  with  his 
view of things; he explained that you only wore it when the 
flies became troublesome. I enquired of the lady if she did not 
find the wind blow cold; she said she had noticed it, especially 
at the corners. I did not ask these questions one after another 
as I have here put them down; I mixed them up with general 
conversation, and we parted on good terms.

I have pondered much upon the apparition, and have come 
to a definite opinion. A man I met later at Frankfort, and to 
whom I described the pair, said he had seen them himself in 
Paris, three weeks after the termination of the Fashoda inci-
dent; while a traveller for some English steel works whom we 
met  in  Strassburg  remembered  having  seen  them  in  Berlin 
during the excitement caused by the Transvaal question. My 
conclusion  is  that  they  were  actors  out  of  work,  hired  to  do 
this  thing  in  the  interest  of  international  peace.  The  French 
Foreign Office, wishful to allay the anger of the Parisian mob 
clamouring for war with England, secured this admirable cou-
ple and sent them round the town. You cannot be amused at a 
thing, and at the same time want to kill it. The French nation 
saw the English citizen and citizeness — no caricature, but the 

— 299 —

living  reality — and  their  indignation  exploded  in  laughter. 
The success of the stratagem prompted them later on to offer 
their services to the German Government, with the beneficial 
results that we all know.

Our own Government might learn the lesson. It might be as 
well to keep near Downing Street a few small, fat Frenchmen, 
to be sent round the country when occasion called for it, shrug-
ging their shoulders and eating frog sandwiches; or a file of 
untidy, lank-haired Germans might be retained, to walk about, 
smoking long pipes, saying “So.” The public would laugh and 
exclaim, “War with such? It would be too absurd.” Failing the 
Government, I recommend the scheme to the Peace Society.
Our visit to Prague we were compelled to lengthen some-
what. Prague is one of the most interesting towns in Europe. 
Its  stones  are  saturated  with  history  and  romance;  its  every 
suburb must have been a battlefield. It is the town that con-
ceived  the  Reformation  and  hatched  the  Thirty  Years’  War. 
But  half  Prague’s  troubles,  one  imagines,  might  have  been 
saved  to  it,  had  it  possessed  windows  less  large  and  tempt-
ingly convenient. The first of these mighty catastrophes it set 
rolling  by  throwing  the  seven  Catholic  councillors  from  the 
windows of its Rathhaus on to the pikes of the Hussites below. 
Later, it gave the signal for the second by again throwing the 
Imperial councillors from the windows of the old Burg in the 
Hradschin — Prague’s second “Fenstersturz.” Since, other fate-
ful questions have been decide in Prague, one assumes from 
their having been concluded without violence that such must 
have been discussed in cellars. The window, as an argument, 
one feels, would always have proved too strong a temptation to 
any true-born Praguer.

In the Teynkirche stands the worm-eaten pulpit from which 
preached  John  Huss.  One  may  hear  from  the  selfsame  desk 
to-day the voice of a Papist priest, while in far-off Constance 
a rude block of stone, half ivy hidden, marks the spot where 
Huss  and  Jerome  died  burning  at  the  stake.  History  is  fond 
of her little ironies. In this same Teynkirche lies buried Tycho 

— 300 —

Brahe,  the  astronomer,  who  made  the  common  mistake  of 
thinking the earth, with its eleven hundred creeds and one hu-
manity, the centre of the universe; but who otherwise observed 
the stars clearly.

Through  Prague’s  dirty,  palace-bordered  alleys  must  have 
pressed often in hot haste blind Ziska and open-minded Wal-
lenstein — they have dubbed him “The Hero” in Prague; and 
the town is honestly proud of having owned him for citizen. In 
his gloomy palace in the Waldstein-Platz they show as a sacred 
spot the cabinet where he prayed, and seem to have persuaded 
themselves he really had a soul. Its steep, winding ways must 
have  been  choked  a  dozen  times,  now  by  Sigismund’s  flying 
legions, followed by fierce-killing Tarborites, and now by pale 
Protestants pursued by the victorious Catholics of Maximilian. 
Now Saxons, now Bavarians, and now French; now the saints 
of  Gustavus Adolphus,  and  now  the  steel  fighting  machines 
of Frederick the Great, have thundered at its gates and fought 
upon its bridges.

The Jews have always been an important feature of Prague. 
Occasionally they have assisted the Christians in their favour-
ite occupation of slaughtering one another, and the great flag 
suspended  from  the  vaulting  of  the Altneuschule  testifies  to 
the  courage  with  which  they  helped  Catholic  Ferdinand  to 
resist  the  Protestant  Swedes.  The  Prague  Ghetto  was  one  of 
the first to be established in Europe, and in the tiny synagogue, 
still  standing,  the  Jew  of  Prague  has  worshipped  for  eight 
hundred years, his women folk devoutly listening, without, at 
the ear holes provided for them in the massive walls. A Jewish 
cemetery adjacent, “Bethchajim, or the House of Life,” seems 
as though it were bursting with its dead. Within its narrow acre 
it was the law of centuries that here or nowhere must the bones 
of Israel rest. So the worn and broken tombstones lie piled in 
close confusion, as though tossed and tumbled by the strug-
gling host beneath.

The  Ghetto  walls  have  long  been  levelled,  but  the  living 
Jews  of  Prague  still  cling  to  their  foetid  lanes,  though  these 

— 301 —

are being rapidly replaced by fine new streets that promise to 
eventually transform this quarter into the handsomest part of 
the town.

At Dresden they advised us not to talk German in Prague. 
For years racial animosity between the German minority and 
the  Czech  majority  has  raged  throughout  Bohemia,  and  to 
be mistaken for a German in certain streets of Prague is in-
convenient to a man whose staying powers in a race are not 
what once they were. However, we did talk German in certain 
streets in Prague; it was a case of talking German or nothing. 
The Czech dialect is said to be of great antiquity and of highly 
scientific  cultivation.  Its  alphabet  contains  forty-two  letters, 
suggestive  to  a  stranger  of  Chinese.  It  is  not  a  language  to 
be picked up in a hurry. We decided that on the whole there 
would be less risk to our constitution in keeping to German, 
and as a matter of fact no harm came to us. The explanation I 
can only surmise. The Praguer is an exceedingly acute person; 
some  subtle  falsity  of  accent,  some  slight  grammatical  inac-
curacy, may have crept into our German, revealing to him the 
fact that, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, we were no 
true-born Deutscher. I do not assert this; I put it forward as a 
possibility.

To avoid unnecessary danger, however, we did our sight-see-
ing with the aid of a guide. No guide I have ever come across 
is perfect. This one had two distinct failings. His English was 
decidedly  weak.  Indeed,  it  was  not  English  at  all.  I  do  not 
know what you would call it. It was not altogether his fault; 
he had learnt English from a Scotch lady. I understand Scotch 
fairly well — to keep abreast of modern English literature this 
is necessary, — but to understand broad Scotch talked with a 
Sclavonic accent, occasionally relieved by German modifica-
tions, taxes the intelligence. For the first hour it was difficult to 
rid one’s self of the conviction that the man was choking. Every 
moment we expected him to die on our hands. In the course 
of the morning we grew accustomed to him, and rid ourselves 
of the instinct to throw him on his back every time he opened 

— 302 —

his mouth, and tear his clothes from him. Later, we came to 
understand a part of what he said, and this led to the discovery 
of his second failing.

It would seem he had lately invented a hair-restorer, which 
he  had  persuaded  a  local  chemist  to  take  up  and  advertise. 
Half his time he had been pointing out to us, not the beau-
ties of Prague, but the benefits likely to accrue to the human 
race  from  the  use  of  this  concoction;  and  the  conventional 
agreement with which, under the impression he was waxing 
eloquent concerning views and architecture, we had met his 
enthusiasm  he  had  attributed  to  sympathetic  interest  in  this 
wretched wash of his.

The  result  was  that  now  there  was  no  keeping  him  away 
from the subject. Ruined palaces and crumbling churches he 
dismissed with curt reference as mere frivolities, encouraging 
a  morbid  taste  for  the  decadent.  His  duty,  as  he  saw  it,  was 
not to lead us to dwell upon the ravages of time, but rather to 
direct our attention to the means of repairing them. What had 
we to do with broken-headed heroes, or bald-headed saints? 
Our interest should be surely in the living world; in the maid-
ens with their flowing tresses, or the flowing tresses they might 
have, by judicious use of “Kophkeo,” in the young men with 
their fierce moustaches — as pictured on the label.

Unconsciously, in his own mind, he had divided the world 
into two sections. The Past (“Before Use”), a sickly, disagree-
able-looking, uninteresting world. The Future (“After Use”) a 
fat, jolly, God-bless-everybody sort of world; and this unfitted 
him as a guide to scenes of mediaeval history.

He sent us each a bottle of the stuff to our hotel. It appeared 
that in the early part of our converse with him we had, unwit-
tingly, clamoured for it. Personally, I can neither praise it nor 
condemn it. A long series of disappointments has disheartened 
me; added to which a permanent atmosphere of paraffin, how-
ever  faint,  is  apt  to  cause  remark,  especially  in  the  case  of  a 
married man. Now, I never try even the sample.

I gave my bottle to George. He asked for it to send to a man 

— 303 —

he knew in Leeds. I learnt later that Harris had given him his 
bottle also, to send to the same man.

A suggestion of onions has clung to this tour since we left 
Prague. George has noticed it himself. He attributes it to the 
prevalence of garlic in European cooking.

It was in Prague that Harris and I did a kind and friendly 
thing  to  George.  We  had  noticed  for  some  time  past  that 
George  was  getting  too  fond  of  Pilsener  beer.  This  German 
beer is an insidious drink, especially in hot weather; but it does 
not do to imbibe too freely of it. It does not get into your head, 
but after a time it spoils your waist. I always say to myself on 
entering Germany:

“Now, I will drink no German beer. The white wine of the 
country, with a little soda-water; perhaps occasionally a glass 
of  Ems  or  potash.  But  beer,  never — or,  at  all  events,  hardly 
ever.”

It  is  a  good  and  useful  resolution,  which  I  recommend  to 
all travellers. I only wish I could keep to it myself. George, al-
though I urged him, refused to bind himself by any such hard 
and fast limit. He said that in moderation German beer was 
good.

“One glass in the morning,” said George, “one in the evening, 

or even two. That will do no harm to anyone.”

Maybe he was right. It was his half-dozen glasses that trou-

bled Harris and myself.

becoming serious.”

“We  ought  to  do  something  to  stop  it,”  said  Harris; “it  is 

“It’s hereditary, so he has explained to me,” I answered. “It 

seems his family have always been thirsty.”

“There  is Apollinaris  water,”  replied  Harris, “which,  I  be-
lieve, with a little lemon squeezed into it, is practically harm-
less. What I am thinking about is his figure. He will lose all his 
natural elegance.”

We  talked  the  matter  over,  and,  Providence  aiding  us,  we 
fixed upon a plan. For the ornamentation of the town a new 
statue had just been cast. I forget of whom it was a statue. I 

— 304 —

only remember that in the essentials it was the usual sort of 
street  statue,  representing  the  usual  sort  of  gentleman,  with 
the usual stiff neck, riding the usual sort of horse — the horse 
that always walks on its hind legs, keeping its front paws for 
beating time. But in detail it possessed individuality. Instead 
of the usual sword or baton, the man was holding, stretched 
out in his hand, his own plumed hat; and the horse, instead of 
the usual waterfall for a tail, possessed a somewhat attenuated 
appendage that somehow appeared out of keeping with his os-
tentatious behaviour. One felt that a horse with a tail like that 
would not have pranced so much.

It stood in a small square not far from the further end of 
the  Karlsbrücke,  but  it  stood  there  only  temporarily.  Before 
deciding finally where to fix it, the town authorities had re-
solved, very sensibly, to judge by practical test where it would 
look best. Accordingly, they had made three rough copies of 
the statue — mere wooden profiles, things that would not bear 
looking  at  closely,  but  which,  viewed  from  a  little  distance, 
produced all the effect that was necessary. One of these they 
had set up at the approach to the Franz-Josefsbrücke, a second 
stood in the open space behind the theatre, and the third in the 
centre of the Wenzelsplatz.

“If George is not in the secret of this thing,” said Harris — we 
were walking by ourselves for an hour, he having remained be-
hind in the hotel to write a letter to his aunt, — “if he has not 
observed these statues, then by their aid we will make a better 
and a thinner man of him, and that this very evening.”

So during dinner we sounded him, judiciously; and finding 
him ignorant of the matter, we took him out, and led him by 
side-streets  to  the  place  where  stood  the  real  statue.  George 
was for looking at it and passing on, as is his way with statues, 
but we insisted on his pulling up and viewing the thing con-
scientiously. We walked him round that statue four times, and 
showed it to him from every possible point of view. I think, on 
the whole, we rather bored him with the thing, but our object 
was  to  impress  it  upon  him. We  told  him  the  history  of  the 

— 305 —

man who rode upon the horse, the name of the artist who had 
made the statue, how much it weighed, how much it measured. 
We  worked  that  statue  into  his  system.  By  the  time  we  had 
done with him he knew more about that statue, for the time 
being,  than  he  knew  about  anything  else. We  soaked  him  in 
that statue, and only let him go at last on the condition that he 
would come again with us in the morning, when we could all 
see it better, and for such purpose we saw to it that he made a 
note in his pocket-book of the place where the statue stood.

Then we accompanied him to his favourite beer hall, and sat 
beside him, telling him anecdotes of men who, unaccustomed 
to German beer, and drinking too much of it, had gone mad 
and developed homicidal mania; of men who had died young 
through  drinking  German  beer;  of  lovers  that  German  beer 
had been the means of parting for ever from beautiful girls.

At ten o’clock we started to walk back to the hotel. It was a 
stormy-looking night, with heavy clouds drifting over a light 
moon. Harris said:

“We won’t go back the same way we came; we’ll walk back 

by the river. It is lovely in the moonlight.”

Harris told a sad history, as we walked, about a man he once 
knew, who is now in a home for harmless imbeciles. He said 
he recalled the story because it was on just such another night 
as this that he was walking with that man the very last time he 
ever saw the poor fellow. They were strolling down the Thames 
Embankment, Harris said, and the man frightened him then 
by persisting that he saw the statue of the Duke of Welling-
ton at the corner of Westminster Bridge, when, as everybody 
knows, it stands in Piccadilly.

It was at this exact instant that we came in sight of the first 
of  these  wooden  copies.  It  occupied  the  centre  of  a  small, 
railed-in square a little above us on the opposite side of the 
way. George suddenly stood still and leant against the wall of 
the quay.

“What’s the matter?” I said; “feeling giddy?”
He said: “I do, a little. Let’s rest here a moment.”

— 306 —

He stood there with his eyes glued to the thing.
He said, speaking huskily:
“Talking  of  statues,  what  always  strikes  me  is  how  very 

much one statue is like another statue.”

Harris  said: “I  cannot  agree  with  you  there — pictures,  if 
you like. Some pictures are very like other pictures, but with 
a statue there is always something distinctive. Take that statue 
we  saw  early  in  the  evening,”  continued  Harris, “before  we 
went into the concert hall. It represented a man sitting on a 
horse. In Prague you will see other statues of men on horses, 
but nothing at all like that one.”

“Yes they are,” said George; “they are all alike. It’s always the 
same horse, and it’s always the same man. They are all exactly 
alike. It’s idiotic nonsense to say they are not.”

He appeared to be angry with Harris.
“What makes you think so?” I asked.
“What makes me think so?” retorted George, now turning 

upon me. “Why, look at that damned thing over there!”

I said: “What damned thing?”
“Why, that thing,” said George; “look at it! There is the same 
horse with half a tail, standing on its hind legs; the same man 
without his hat; the same —”

Harris said: “You are talking now about the statue we saw in 

the Ringplatz.”

over there.”

“No, I’m not,” replied George; “I’m talking about the statue 

“What statue?” said Harris.
George  looked  at  Harris;  but  Harris  is  a  man  who  might, 
with  care,  have  been  a  fair  amateur  actor.  His  face  merely 
expressed friendly sorrow, mingled with alarm. Next, George 
turned his gaze on me. I endeavoured, so far as lay with me, 
to copy Harris’s expression, adding to it on my own account a 
touch of reproof.

“Will you have a cab?” I said as kindly as I could to George. 

“I’ll run and get one.”

“What the devil do I want with a cab?” he answered, ungra-

— 307 —

ciously. “Can’t  you  fellows  understand  a  joke?  It’s  like  being 
out with a couple of confounded old women,” saying which, he 
started off across the bridge, leaving us to follow.

“I am so glad that was only a joke of yours,” said Harris, on 
our overtaking him. “I knew a case of softening of the brain 
that began —”

“Oh, you’re a silly ass!” said George, cutting him short; “you 

know everything.”

He was really most unpleasant in his manner.
We took him round by the riverside of the theatre. We told 
him it was the shortest way, and, as a matter of fact, it was. In 
the open space behind the theatre stood the second of these 
wooden apparitions. George looked at it, and again stood still.
“What’s the matter?” said Harris, kindly. “You are not ill, are 

you?”

“I don’t believe this is the shortest way,” said George.
“I assure you it is,” persisted Harris.
“Well, I’m going the other,” said George; and he turned and 

went, we, as before, following him.

Along the Ferdinand Strasse Harris and I talked about pri-
vate lunatic asylums, which, Harris said, were not well man-
aged in England. He said a friend of his, a patient in a lunatic 
asylum —

George  said,  interrupting:  “You  appear  to  have  a  large 

number of friends in lunatic asylums.”

He  said  it  in  a  most  insulting  tone,  as  though  to  imply 
that that is where one would look for the majority of Harris’s 
friends. But Harris did not get angry; he merely replied, quite 
mildly:

“Well, it really is extraordinary, when one comes to think of 
it, how many of them have gone that way sooner or later. I get 
quite nervous sometimes, now.”

At  the  corner  of  the Wenzelsplatz,  Harris,  who  was  a  few 

steps ahead of us, paused.

“It’s a fine street, isn’t it?” he said, sticking his hands in his 

pockets, and gazing up at it admiringly.

— 308 —

George and I followed suit. Two hundred yards away from 
us, in its very centre, was the third of these ghostly statues. I 
think it was the best of the three — the most like, the most de-
ceptive. It stood boldly outlined against the wild sky: the horse 
on  its  hind  legs,  with  its  curiously  attenuated  tail;  the  man 
bareheaded, pointing with his plumed hat to the now entirely 
visible moon.

“I  think,  if  you  don’t  mind,”  said  George — he  spoke  with 
almost a pathetic ring in his voice, his aggressiveness had com-
pletely fallen from him, — “that I will have that cab, if there’s 
one handy.”

“I thought you were looking queer,” said Harris, kindly. “It’s 

your head, isn’t it?”

“Perhaps it is,” answered George.
“I have noticed it coining on,” said Harris; “but I didn’t like 

to say anything to you. You fancy you see things, don’t you?”

“No, no; it isn’t that,” replied George, rather quickly. “I don’t 

know what it is.”

“I do,” said Harris, solemnly, “and I’ll tell you. It’s this Ger-
man beer that you are drinking. I have known a case where a 
man —”

“Don’t tell me about him just now,” said George. “I dare say 

it’s true, but somehow I don’t feel I want to hear about him.”

“You are not used to it,” said Harris.
“I shall give it up from to-night,” said George. “I think you 

must be right; it doesn’t seem to agree with me.”

We took him home, and saw him to bed. He was very gentle 

and quite grateful.

One evening later on, after a long day’s ride, followed by a 
most satisfactory dinner, we started him on a big cigar, and, re-
moving things from his reach, told him of this stratagem that 
for his good we had planned.

“How many copies of that statue did you say we saw?” asked 

George, after we had finished.

“Three,” replied Harris.
“Only three?” said George. “Are you sure?”

— 309 —

“Positive,” replied Harris. “Why?”
“Oh, nothing!” answered George.
But I don’t think he quite believed Harris.
From Prague we travelled to Nuremberg, through Carlsbad. 
Good  Germans,  when  they  die,  go,  they  say,  to  Carlsbad,  as 
good Americans to Paris. This I doubt, seeing that it is a small 
place with no convenience for a crowd. In Carlsbad, you rise 
at  five,  the  fashionable  hour  for  promenade,  when  the  band 
plays  under  the  Colonnade,  and  the  Sprudel  is  filled  with  a 
packed throng over a mile long, being from six to eight in the 
morning. Here you may hear more languages spoken than the 
Tower  of  Babel  could  have  echoed.  Polish  Jews  and  Russian 
princes, Chinese mandarins and Turkish pashas, Norwegians 
looking  as  if  they  had  stepped  out  of  Ibsen’s  plays,  women 
from  the  Boulevards,  Spanish  grandees  and  English  coun-
tesses, mountaineers from Montenegro and millionaires from 
Chicago, you will find every dozen yards. Every luxury in the 
world Carlsbad provides for its visitors, with the one exception 
of pepper. That you cannot get within five miles of the town 
for money; what you can get there for love is not worth tak-
ing away. Pepper, to the liver brigade that forms four-fifths of 
Carlsbad’s customers, is poison; and, prevention being better 
than cure, it is carefully kept out of the neighbourhood. “Pep-
per parties” are formed in Carlsbad to journey to some place 
without the boundary, and there indulge in pepper orgies.

Nuremberg, if one expects a town of mediaeval appearance, 
disappoints.  Quaint  corners,  picturesque  glimpses,  there  are 
in plenty; but everywhere they are surrounded and intruded 
upon by the modern, and even what is ancient is not nearly so 
ancient as one thought it was. After all, a town, like a woman, 
is only as old as it looks; and Nuremberg is still a comfortable-
looking dame, its age somewhat difficult to conceive under its 
fresh paint and stucco in the blaze of the gas and the electric 
light. Still, looking closely, you may see its wrinkled walls and 
grey towers.

ALL three of us, by some means or another, managed, between 
Nuremberg and the Black Forest, to get into trouble.

Harris led off at Stuttgart by insulting an official. Stuttgart 
is a charming town, clean and bright, a smaller Dresden. It has 
the additional attraction of containing little that one need to 
go out of one’s way to see: a medium-sized picture gallery, a 
small  museum  of  antiquities,  and  half  a  palace,  and  you  are 
through with the entire thing and can enjoy yourself. Harris 
did not know it was an official he was insulting. He took it for 
a fireman (it looked liked a fireman), and he called it a “dum-
mer Esel.”

In German you are not permitted to call an official a “silly 
ass,” but undoubtedly this particular man was one. What had 
happened was this: Harris in the Stadgarten, anxious to get out, 
and seeing a gate open before him, had stepped over a wire into 
the street. Harris maintains he never saw it, but undoubtedly 
there was hanging to the wire a notice, “Durchgang Verboten!” 
The man, who was standing near the gates stopped Harris, and 
pointed out to him this notice. Harris thanked him, and passed 
on. The man came after him, and explained that treatment of 
the matter in such off-hand way could not be allowed; what 
was necessary to put the business right was that Harris should 
step back over the wire into the garden. Harris pointed out to 
the man that the notice said “going through forbidden,” and 
that, therefore, by re-entering the garden that way he would be 

— 311 —

infringing the law a second time. The man saw this for himself, 
and suggested that to get over the difficulty Harris should go 
back into the garden by the proper entrance, which was round 
the corner, and afterwards immediately come out again by the 
same gate. Then it was that Harris called the man a silly ass. 
That delayed us a day, and cost Harris forty marks.

I followed suit at Carlsruhe, by stealing a bicycle. I did not 
mean to steal the bicycle; I was merely trying to be useful. The 
train was on the point of starting when I noticed, as I thought, 
Harris’s bicycle still in the goods van. No one was about to help 
me. I jumped into the van and hauled it out, only just in time. 
Wheeling it down the platform in triumph, I came across Har-
ris’s  bicycle,  standing  against  a  wall  behind  some  milk-cans. 
The  bicycle  I  had  secured  was  not  Harris’s,  but  some  other 
man’s.

It was an awkward situation. In England, I should have gone 
to  the  stationmaster  and  explained  my  mistake.  But  in  Ger-
many they are not content with your explaining a little mat-
ter of this sort to one man: they take you round and get you 
to explain it to about half a dozen; and if any one of the half 
dozen happens not to be handy, or not to have time just then 
to listen to you, they have a habit of leaving you over for the 
night to finish your explanation the next morning. I thought I 
would just put the thing out of sight, and then, without mak-
ing any fuss or show, take a short walk. I found a wood shed, 
which seemed just the very place, and was wheeling the bicycle 
into it when, unfortunately, a red-hatted railway official, with 
the airs of a retired field-marshal, caught sight of me and came 
up. He said:

“What are you doing with that bicycle?”
I said: “I am going to put it in this wood shed out of the 
way.” I tried to convey by my tone that I was performing a kind 
and thoughtful action, for which the railway officials ought to 
thank me; but he was unresponsive.

“Is it your bicycle?” he said.
“Well, not exactly,” I replied.

— 312 —

“Whose is it?” he asked, quite sharply.
“I can’t tell you,” I answered. “I don’t know whose bicycle it 

is.”

“Where did you get it from?” was his next question. There 
was a suspiciousness about his tone that was almost insulting.
“I got it,” I answered, with as much calm dignity as at the 
moment I could assume, “out of the train. The fact is,” I con-
tinued, frankly, “I have made a mistake.”

He  did  not  allow  me  time  to  finish.  He  merely  said  he 

thought so too, and blew a whistle.

Recollection of the subsequent proceedings is not, so far as 
I  am  concerned,  amusing.  By  a  miracle  of  good  luck — they 
say Providence watches over certain of us — the incident hap-
pened in Carlsruhe, where I possess a German friend, an offi-
cial of some importance. Upon what would have been my fate 
had the station not been at Carlsruhe, or had my friend been 
from home, I do not care to dwell; as it was I got off, as the 
saying is, by the skin of my teeth. I should like to add that I left 
Carlsruhe without a stain upon my character, but that would 
not be the truth. My going scot free is regarded in police circles 
there to this day as a grave miscarriage of justice.

But all lesser sin sinks into insignificance beside the lawless-
ness  of  George.  The  bicycle  incident  had  thrown  us  all  into 
confusion,  with  the  result  that  we  lost  George  altogether.  It 
transpired subsequently that he was waiting for us outside the 
police court; but this at the time we did not know. We thought, 
maybe, he had gone on to Baden by himself; and anxious to 
get away from Carlsruhe, and not, perhaps, thinking out things 
too clearly, we jumped into the next train that came up and 
proceeded thither. When George, tired of waiting, returned to 
the station, he found us gone and he found his luggage gone. 
Harris had his ticket; I was acting as banker to the party, so 
that he had in his pocket only some small change. Excusing 
himself upon these grounds, he thereupon commenced delib-
erately a career of crime that, reading it later, as set forth baldly 

— 313 —

in the official summons, made the hair of Harris and myself 
almost to stand on end.

German travelling, it may be explained, is somewhat com-
plicated. You buy a ticket at the station you start from for the 
place you want to go to. You might think this would enable you 
to get there, but it does not. When your train comes up, you at-
tempt to swarm into it; but the guard magnificently waves you 
away. Where are your credentials? You show him your ticket. 
He explains to you that by itself that is of no service whatever; 
you have only taken the first step towards travelling; you must 
go  back  to  the  booking-office  and  get  in  addition  what  is 
called a “schnellzug ticket.” With this you return, thinking your 
troubles over. You are allowed to get in, so far so good. But you 
must not sit down anywhere, and you must not stand still, and 
you must not wander about. You must take another ticket, this 
time what is called a “platz ticket,” which entitles you to a place 
for a certain distance.

What a man could do who persisted in taking nothing but 
the one ticket, I have often wondered. Would he be entitled to 
run behind the train on the six-foot way? Or could he stick a 
label on himself and get into the goods van? Again, what could 
be done with the man who, having taken his schnellzug ticket, 
obstinately refused, or had not the money to take a platz ticket: 
would they let him lie in the umbrella rack, or allow him to 
hang himself out of the window?

To return to George, he had just sufficient money to take a 
third-class slow train ticket to Baden, and that was all. To avoid 
the  inquisitiveness  of  the  guard,  he  waited  till  the  train  was 
moving, and then jumped in.
That was his first sin:
(a)  Entering a train in motion;
(b)  After being warned not to do so by an official.
Second sin:
(a)  Travelling in train of superior class to that for which ticket 

was held.

(b)  Refusing to pay difference when demanded by an official. 

— 314 —

(George says he did not “refuse”; he simply told the man he 
had not got it.)

Third sin:
(a)  Travelling in carriage of superior class to that for which 

ticket was held.

(b)  Refusing  to  pay  difference  when  demanded  by  an  of-
ficial.  (Again  George  disputes  the  accuracy  of  the  report. 
He turned his pockets out, and offered the man all he had, 
which was about eightpence in German money. He offered 
to go into a third class, but there was no third class. He of-
fered to go into the goods van, but they would not hear of 
it.)

Fourth sin:
(a)  Occupying seat, and not paying for same.
(b)  Loitering  about  corridor.  (As  they  would  not  let  him  sit 
down without paying, and as he could not pay, it was dif-
ficult to see what else he could do.)
But explanations are held as no excuse in Germany; and his 
journey from Carlsruhe to Baden was one of the most expen-
sive perhaps on record.

Reflecting upon the case and frequency with which one gets 
into trouble here in Germany, one is led to the conclusion that 
this country would come as a boon and a blessing to the aver-
age young Englishman. To the medical student, to the eater of 
dinners at the Temple, to the subaltern on leave, life in London 
is a wearisome proceeding. The healthy Briton takes his pleas-
ure lawlessly, or it is no pleasure to him. Nothing that he may 
do affords to him any genuine satisfaction. To be in trouble of 
some sort is his only idea of bliss. Now, England affords him 
small opportunity in this respect; to get himself into a scrape 
requires a good deal of persistence on the part of the young 
Englishman.

I spoke on this subject one day with our senior churchward-
en. It was the morning of the 10th of November, and we were 
both of us glancing, somewhat anxiously, through the police 
reports. The usual batch of young men had been summoned 

— 315 —

for creating the usual disturbance the night before at the Cri-
terion. My friend the churchwarden has boys of his own, and a 
nephew of mine, upon whom I am keeping a fatherly eye, is by 
a fond mother supposed to be in London for the sole purpose 
of  studying  engineering.  No  names  we  knew  happened,  by 
fortunate chance, to be in the list of those detained in custody, 
and, relieved, we fell to moralising upon the folly and deprav-
ity of youth.

“It  is  very  remarkable,”  said  my  friend  the  churchwarden, 
“how the Criterion retains its position in this respect. It was 
just so when I was young; the evening always wound up with 
a row at the Criterion.”

“So meaningless,” I remarked.
“So monotonous,” he replied. “You have no idea,” he contin-
ued, a dreamy expression stealing over his furrowed face, “how 
unutterably tired one can become of the walk from Piccadilly 
Circus to the Vine Street Police Court. Yet, what else was there 
for us to do? Simply nothing. Sometimes we would put out a 
street lamp, and a man would come round and light it again. If 
one insulted a policeman, he simply took no notice. He did not 
even know he was being insulted; or, if he did, he seemed not 
to care. You could fight a Covent Garden porter, if you fancied 
yourself at that sort of thing. Generally speaking, the porter 
got the best of it; and when he did it cost you five shillings, and 
when he did not the price was half a sovereign. I could never 
see much excitement in that particular sport. I tried driving a 
hansom cab once. That has always been regarded as the acme 
of  modern  Tom  and  Jerryism.  I  stole  it  late  one  night  from 
outside a public-house in Dean Street, and the first thing that 
happened to me was that I was hailed in Golden Square by an 
old lady surrounded by three children, two of them crying and 
the third one half asleep. Before I could get away she had shot 
the brats into the cab, taken my number, paid me, so she said, 
a shilling over the legal fare, and directed me to an address a 
little beyond what she called North Kensington. As a matter of 
fact, the place turned out to be the other side of Willesden. The 

— 316 —

horse was tired, and the journey took us well over two hours. 
It was the slowest lark I ever remember being concerned in. I 
tried one or twice to persuade the children to let me take them 
back to the old lady: but every time I opened the trap-door 
to speak to them the youngest one, a boy, started screaming; 
and when I offered other drivers to transfer the job to them, 
most  of  them  replied  in  the  words  of  a  song  popular  about 
that period: ‘Oh, George, don’t you think you’re going just a 
bit too far?’ One man offered to take home to my wife any last 
message  I  might  be  thinking  of,  while  another  promised  to 
organise a party to come and dig me out in the spring. When I 
mounted the dickey I had imagined myself driving a peppery 
old colonel to some lonesome and cabless region, half a dozen 
miles from where he wanted to go, and there leaving him upon 
the kerbstone to swear. About that there might have been good 
sport or there might not, according to circumstances and the 
colonel. The idea of a trip to an outlying suburb in charge of a 
nursery full of helpless infants had never occurred to me. No, 
London,” concluded my friend the churchwarden with a sigh, 
“affords but limited opportunity to the lover of the illegal.”

Now, in Germany, on the other hand, trouble is to be had 
for  the  asking.  There  are  many  things  in  Germany  that  you 
must not do that are quite easy to do. To any young English-
man yearning to get himself into a scrape, and finding himself 
hampered in his own country, I would advise a single ticket 
to Germany; a return, lasting as it does only a month, might 
prove a waste.

In the Police Guide of the Fatherland he will find set forth 
a list of the things the doing of which will bring to him inter-
est and excitement. In Germany you must not hang your bed 
out of the window. He might begin with that. By waving his 
bed  out  of  window  he  could  get  into  trouble  before  he  had 
his breakfast. At home he might hang himself out of window, 
and nobody would mind much, provided he did not obstruct 
anybody’s ancient lights or break away and injure any passer 
underneath.

— 317 —

In Germany you must not wear fancy dress in the streets. A 
Highlander of my acquaintance who came to pass the winter 
in Dresden spent the first few days of his residence there in 
arguing this question with the Saxon Government. They asked 
him what he was doing in those clothes. He was not an ami-
able man. He answered, he was wearing them. They asked him 
why he was wearing them. He replied, to keep himself warm. 
They told him frankly that they did not believe him, and sent 
him  back  to  his  lodgings  in  a  closed  landau.  The  personal 
testimony of the English Minister was necessary to assure the 
authorities that the Highland garb was the customary dress of 
many respectable, law-abiding British subjects. They accepted 
the statement, as diplomatically bound, but retain their private 
opinion to this day. The English tourist they have grown ac-
customed to; but a Leicestershire gentleman, invited to hunt 
with  some  German  officers,  on  appearing  outside  his  hotel, 
was promptly marched off, horse and all, to explain his frivol-
ity at the police court.

Another  thing  you  must  not  do  in  the  streets  of  German 
towns is to feed horses, mules, or donkeys, whether your own 
or those belonging to other people. If a passion seizes you to 
feed  somebody  else’s  horse,  you  must  make  an  appointment 
with the animal, and the meal must take place in some prop-
erly authorised place. You must not break glass or china in the 
street, nor, in fact, in any public resort whatever; and if you 
do, you must pick up all the pieces. What you are to do with 
the pieces when you have gathered them together I cannot say. 
The only thing I know for certain is that you are not permitted 
to throw them anywhere, to leave them anywhere, or appar-
ently to part with them in any way whatever. Presumably, you 
are expected to carry them about with you until you die, and 
then be buried with them; or, maybe, you are allowed to swal-
low them.

In  German  streets  you  must  not  shoot  with  a  crossbow. 
The  German  law-maker  does  not  content  himself  with  the 
misdeeds of the average man — the crime one feels one wants 

— 318 —

to  do,  but  must  not:  he  worries  himself  imagining  all  the 
things a wandering maniac might do. In Germany there is no 
law against a man standing on his head in the middle of the 
road; the idea has not occurred to them. One of these days a 
German statesman, visiting a circus and seeing acrobats, will 
reflect  upon  this  omission.  Then  he  will  straightway  set  to 
work and frame a clause forbidding people from standing on 
their heads in the middle of the road, and fixing a fine. This 
is the charm of German law: misdemeanour in Germany has 
its fixed price. You are not kept awake all night, as in England, 
wondering whether you will get off with a caution, be fined 
forty shillings, or, catching the magistrate in an unhappy mo-
ment for yourself, get seven days. You know exactly what your 
fun is going to cost you. You can spread out your money on 
the table, open your Police Guide, and plan out your holiday 
to  a  fifty  pfennig  piece.  For  a  really  cheap  evening,  I  would 
recommend walking on the wrong side of the pavement after 
being cautioned not to do so. I calculate that by choosing your 
district and keeping to the quiet side streets you could walk for 
a whole evening on the wrong side of the pavement at a cost of 
little over three marks.

In German towns you must not ramble about after dark “in 
droves.”  I  am  not  quite  sure  how  many  constitute  a “drove,” 
and no official to whom I have spoken on this subject has felt 
himself competent to fix the exact number. I once put it to a 
German friend who was starting for the theatre with his wife, 
his mother-in-law, five children of his own, his sister and her 
fiance, and two nieces, if he did not think he was running a 
risk under this by-law. He did not take my suggestion as a joke. 
He cast an eye over the group.

“Oh, I don’t think so,” he said; “you see, we are all one fam-

ily.”

“The paragraph says nothing about its being a family drove 
or not,” I replied; “it simply says ‘drove.’ I do not mean it in 
any  uncomplimentary  sense,  but,  speaking  etymologically,  I 
am inclined personally to regard your collection as a ‘drove.’ 

— 319 —

Whether the police will take the same view or not remains to 
be seen. I am merely warning you.”

My  friend  himself  was  inclined  to  pooh-pooh  my  fears; 
but  his  wife  thinking  it  better  not  to  run  any  risk  of  having 
the party broken up by the police at the very beginning of the 
evening, they divided, arranging to come together again in the 
theatre lobby.

Another  passion  you  must  restrain  in  Germany  is  that 
prompting  you  to  throw  things  out  of  window.  Cats  are  no 
excuse.  During  the  first  week  of  my  residence  in  Germany 
I  was  awakened  incessantly  by  cats.  One  night  I  got  mad.  I 
collected a small arsenal — two or three pieces of coal, a few 
hard pears, a couple of candle ends, an odd egg I found on the 
kitchen table, an empty soda-water bottle, and a few articles 
of that sort, — and, opening the window, bombarded the spot 
from where the noise appeared to come. I do not suppose I hit 
anything; I never knew a man who did hit a cat, even when 
he  could  see  it,  except,  maybe,  by  accident  when  aiming  at 
something else. I have known crack shots, winners of Queen’s 
prizes — those sort of men, — shoot with shot-guns at cats fifty 
yards away, and never hit a hair. I have often thought that, in-
stead of bull’s-eyes, running deer, and that rubbish, the really 
superior marksman would be he who could boast that he had 
shot the cat.

But, anyhow, they moved off; maybe the egg annoyed them. I 
had noticed when I picked it up that it did not look a good egg; 
and I went back to bed again, thinking the incident closed. Ten 
minutes afterwards there came a violent ringing of the electric 
bell. I tried to ignore it, but it was too persistent, and, putting 
on my dressing gown, I went down to the gate. A policeman 
was standing there. He had all the things I had been throwing 
out of the window in a little heap in front of him, all except the 
egg. He had evidently been collecting them. He said:

“Are these things yours?”
I  said: “They  were  mine,  but  personally  I  have  done  with 

them. Anybody can have them — you can have them.”

— 320 —

He ignored my offer. He said:
“You threw these things out of window.”
“You are right,” I admitted; “I did.”
“Why  did  you  throw  them  out  of  window?”  he  asked.  A 
German  policeman  has  his  code  of  questions  arranged  for 
him; he never varies them, and he never omits one.

“I threw them out of the window at some cats,” I answered.
“What cats?” he asked.
It was the sort of question a German policeman would ask. I 
replied with as much sarcasm as I could put into my accent that 
I was ashamed to say I could not tell him what cats. I explained 
that, personally, they were strangers to me; but I offered, if the 
police would call all the cats in the district together, to come 
round and see if I could recognise them by their yaul.

The German policeman does not understand a joke, which 
is  perhaps  on  the  whole  just  as  well,  for  I  believe  there  is  a 
heavy fine for joking with any German uniform; they call it 
“treating an official with contumely.” He merely replied that 
it was not the duty of the police to help me recognise the cats; 
their duty was merely to fine me for throwing things out of 
window.

I asked what a man was supposed to do in Germany when 
woke up night after night by cats, and he explained that I could 
lodge an information against the owner of the cat, when the 
police would proceed to caution him, and, if necessary, order 
the cat to be destroyed. Who was going to destroy the cat, and 
what  the  cat  would  be  doing  during  the  process,  he  did  not 
explain.

I asked him how he proposed I should discover the owner 
of the cat. He thought for a while, and then suggested that I 
might follow it home. I did not feel inclined to argue with him 
any more after that; I should only have said things that would 
have made the matter worse. As it was, that night’s sport cost 
me twelve marks; and not a single one of the four German of-
ficials who interviewed me on the subject could see anything 
ridiculous in the proceedings from beginning to end.

— 321 —

But  in  Germany  most  human  faults  and  follies  sink  into 
comparative insignificance beside the enormity of walking on 
the grass. Nowhere, and under no circumstances, may you at 
any time in Germany walk on the grass. Grass in Germany is 
quite a fetish. To put your foot on German grass would be as 
great a sacrilege as to dance a hornpipe on a Mohammedan’s 
praying-mat.  The  very  dogs  respect  German  grass;  no  Ger-
man dog would dream of putting a paw on it. If you see a dog 
scampering  across  the  grass  in  Germany,  you  may  know  for 
certain that it is the dog of some unholy foreigner. In England, 
when we want to keep dogs out of places, we put up wire net-
ting, six feet high, supported by buttresses, and defended on 
the top by spikes. In Germany, they put a notice-board in the 
middle  of  the  place, “Hunden  verboten,”  and  a  dog  that  has 
German blood in its veins looks at that notice-board and walks 
away. In a German park I have seen a gardener step gingerly 
with  felt  boots  on  to  grass-plot,  and  removing  therefrom  a 
beetle, place it gravely but firmly on the gravel; which done, he 
stood sternly watching the beetle, to see that it did not try to 
get back on the grass; and the beetle, looking utterly ashamed 
of itself, walked hurriedly down the gutter, and turned up the 
path marked “Ausgang.”

In  German  parks  separate  roads  are  devoted  to  the  dif-
ferent  orders  of  the  community,  and  no  one  person,  at  peril 
of  liberty  and  fortune,  may  go  upon  another  person’s  road. 
There  are  special  paths  for “wheel-riders”  and  special  paths 
for “foot-goers,”  avenues  for “horse-riders,”  roads  for  people 
in light vehicles, and roads for people in heavy vehicles; ways 
for children and for “alone ladies.” That no particular route has 
yet been set aside for bald-headed men or “new women” has 
always struck me as an omission.

In the Grosse Garten in Dresden I once came across an old 
lady, standing, helpless and bewildered, in the centre of seven 
tracks. Each was guarded by a threatening notice, warning eve-
rybody off it but the person for whom it was intended.

“I am sorry to trouble you,” said the old lady, on learning I 

— 322 —

could speak English and read German, “but would you mind 
telling me what I am and where I have to go?”

I inspected her carefully. I came to the conclusion that she 
was a “grown-up” and a “foot-goer,” and pointed out her path. 
She looked at it, and seemed disappointed.

“But I don’t want to go down there,” she said; “mayn’t I go 

“Great  heavens,  no,  madam!”  I  replied. “That  path  is  re-

this way?”

served for children.”

“But I wouldn’t do them any harm,” said the old lady, with 
a smile. She did not look the sort of old lady who would have 
done them any harm.

“Madam,” I replied, “if it rested with me, I would trust you 
down that path, though my own first-born were at the other 
end; but I can only inform you of the laws of this country. For 
you, a full-grown woman, to venture down that path is to go to 
certain fine, if not imprisonment. There is your path, marked 
plainly — Nur für Fussgänger, and if you will follow my advice, 
you will hasten down it; you are not allowed to stand here and 
hesitate.”

“It doesn’t lead a bit in the direction I want to go,” said the 

“It leads in the direction you ought to want to go,” I replied, 

old lady.

and we parted.

In the German parks there are special seats labelled, “Only 
for grown-ups” (Nur für Erwachsene), and the German small 
boy,  anxious  to  sit  down,  and  reading  that  notice,  passes  by, 
and hunts for a seat on which children are permitted to rest; 
and there he seats himself, careful not to touch the woodwork 
with his muddy boots. Imagine a seat in Regent’s or St. James’s 
Park labelled “Only for grown-ups!” Every child for five miles 
round would be trying to get on that seat, and hauling other 
children  off  who  were  on. As  for  any “grown-up,”  he  would 
never  be  able  to  get  within  half  a  mile  of  that  seat  for  the 
crowd. The German small boy, who has accidentally sat down 
on  such  without  noticing,  rises  with  a  start  when  his  error 

— 323 —

is  pointed  out  to  him,  and  goes  away  with  down-cast  head, 
brushing to the roots of his hair with shame and regret.

Not that the German child is neglected by a paternal Gov-
ernment. In German parks and public gardens special places 
(Spielplätze)  are  provided  for  him,  each  one  supplied  with  a 
heap of sand. There he can play to his heart’s content at mak-
ing mud pies and building sand castles. To the German child a 
pie made of any other mud than this would appear an immoral 
pie. It would give to him no satisfaction: his soul would revolt 
against it.

“That pie,” he would say to himself, “was not, as it should 
have been, made of Government mud specially set apart for 
the purpose; it was not manufactured in the place planned and 
maintained by the Government for the making of mud pies. It 
can bring no real blessing with it; it is a lawless pie.” And until 
his  father  had  paid  the  proper  fine,  and  he  had  received  his 
proper licking, his conscience would continue to trouble him.
Another  excellent  piece  of  material  for  obtaining  excite-
ment in Germany is the simple domestic perambulator. What 
you  may  do  with  a “kinder-wagen,”  as  it  is  called,  and  what 
you may not, covers pages of German law; after the reading 
of which, you conclude that the man who can push a peram-
bulator through a German town without breaking the law was 
meant for a diplomatist. You must not loiter with a perambu-
lator, and you must not go too fast. You must not get in any-
body’s way with a perambulator, and if anybody gets in your 
way you must get out of their way. If you want to stop with 
a  perambulator,  you  must  go  to  a  place  specially  appointed 
where perambulators may stop; and when you get there you 
must stop. You must not cross the road with a perambulator; 
if you and the baby happen to live on the other side, that is 
your fault. You must not leave your perambulator anywhere, 
and only in certain places can you take it with you. I should 
say  that  in  Germany  you  could  go  out  with  a  perambulator 
and get into enough trouble in half an hour to last you for a 
month. Any young Englishman anxious for a row with the po-

— 324 —

lice could not do better than come over to Germany and bring 
his perambulator with him.

In Germany you must not leave your front door unlocked 
after ten o’clock at night, and you must not play the piano in 
your  own  house  after  eleven.  In  England  I  have  never  felt  I 
wanted to play the piano myself, or to hear anyone else play it, 
after eleven o’clock at night; but that is a very different thing to 
being told that you must not play it. Here, in Germany, I never 
feel that I really care for the piano until eleven o’clock, then I 
could sit and listen to the “Maiden’s Prayer,” or the Overture 
to “Zampa,” with pleasure. To the law-loving German, on the 
other hand, music after eleven o’clock at night ceases to be mu-
sic; it becomes sin, and as such gives him no satisfaction.

The only individual throughout Germany who ever dreams 
of taking liberties with the law is the German student, and he 
only to a certain well-defined point. By custom, certain privi-
leges are permitted to him, but even these are strictly limited 
and clearly understood. For instance, the German student may 
get drunk and fall asleep in the gutter with no other penalty 
than that of having the next morning to tip the policeman who 
has found him and brought him home. But for this purpose he 
must choose the gutters of side-streets. The German student, 
conscious  of  the  rapid  approach  of  oblivion,  uses  all  his  re-
maining energy to get round the corner, where he may collapse 
without anxiety. In certain districts he may ring bells. The rent 
of flats in these localities is lower than in other quarters of the 
town; while the difficulty is further met by each family prepar-
ing for itself a secret code of bell-ringing by means of which it 
is known whether the summons is genuine or not. When visit-
ing such a household late at night it is well to be acquainted 
with this code, or you may, if persistent, get a bucket of water 
thrown over you.

Also  the  German  student  is  allowed  to  put  out  lights  at 
night, but there is a prejudice against his putting out too many. 
The larky German student generally keeps count, contenting 
himself with half a dozen lights per night. Likewise, he may 

— 325 —

shout and sing as he walks home, up till half-past two; and at 
certain restaurants it is permitted to him to put his arm round 
the  Fraulein’s  waist.  To  prevent  any  suggestion  of  unseemli-
ness, the waitresses at restaurants frequented by students are 
always carefully selected from among a staid and elderly classy 
of women, by reason of which the German student can enjoy 
the delights of flirtation without fear and without reproach to 
anyone.

They are a law-abiding people, the Germans.

CHAPTER X

Baden from the visitor’s point of view — Beauty of the early morn-
ing, as viewed from the preceding afternoon — Distance, as meas-
ured by the compass — Ditto, as measured by the leg — George in 
account with his conscience — A lazy machine — Bicycling, accord-
ing to the poster: its restfulness — The poster cyclist: its costume; 
its method — The griffin as a household pet — A dog with proper 

self-respect — The horse that was abused.

FROM  Baden,  about  which  it  need  only  be  said  that  it  is  a 
pleasure  resort  singularly  like  other  pleasure  resorts  of  the 
same description, we started bicycling in earnest. We planned 
a  ten  days’  tour,  which,  while  completing  the  Black  Forest, 
should  include  a  spin  down  the  Donau-Thal,  which  for  the 
twenty miles from Tuttlingen to Sigmaringen is, perhaps, the 
finest valley in Germany; the Danube stream here winding its 
narrow way past old-world unspoilt villages; past ancient mon-
asteries, nestling in green pastures, where still the bare-footed 
and  bare-headed  friar,  his  rope  girdle  tight  about  his  loins, 
shepherds, with crook in hand, his sheep upon the hill sides; 
through rocky woods; between sheer walls of cliff, whose eve-
ry towering crag stands crowned with ruined fortress, church, 
or castle; together with a blick at the Vosges mountains, where 
half the population is bitterly pained if you speak to them in 
French, the other half being insulted when you address them 
in  German,  and  the  whole  indignantly  contemptuous  at  the 
first sound of English; a state of things that renders conversa-
tion with the stranger somewhat nervous work.

We did not succeed in carrying out our programme in its 
entirety,  for  the  reason  that  human  performance  lags  ever 
behind human intention. It is easy to say and believe at three 
o’clock  in  the  afternoon  that: “We  will  rise  at  five,  breakfast 
lightly at half-past, and start away at six.”

“Then we shall be well on our way before the heat of the day 

sets in,” remarks one.

“This time of the year, the early morning is really the best 

part of the day. Don’t you think so?” adds another.

— 327 —

“Oh, undoubtedly.”
“So cool and fresh.”
“And the half-lights are so exquisite.”
The first morning one maintains one’s vows. The party as-
sembles at half-past five. It is very silent; individually, some-
what  snappy;  inclined  to  grumble  with  its  food,  also  with 
most other things; the atmosphere charged with compressed 
irritability seeking its vent. In the evening the Tempter’s voice 
is heard:

“I think if we got off by half-past six, sharp, that would be 

The voice of Virtue protests, faintly: “It will be breaking our 

time enough?”

resolution.”

The Tempter replies: “Resolutions were made for man, not 
man for resolutions.” The devil can paraphrase Scripture for 
his  own  purpose. “Besides,  it  is  disturbing  the  whole  hotel; 
think of the poor servants.”

The voice of Virtue continues, but even feebler: “But every-

body gets up early in these parts.”

“They would not if they were not obliged to, poor things! 
Say breakfast at half-past six, punctual; that will be disturbing 
nobody.”

Thus  Sin  masquerades  under  the  guise  of  Good,  and  one 
sleeps  till  six,  explaining  to  one’s  conscience,  who,  however, 
doesn’t believe it, that one does this because of unselfish con-
sideration for others. I have known such consideration extend 
until seven of the clock.

Likewise, distance measured with a pair of compasses is not 

precisely the same as when measured by the leg.

“Ten miles an hour for seven hours, seventy miles. A nice 

easy day’s work.”

“There are some stiff hills to climb?”
“The other side to come down. Say, eight miles an hour, and 
call  it  sixty  miles.  Gott  in  Himmel!  if  we  can’t  average  eight 
miles an hour, we had better go in bath-chairs.” It does seem 
somewhat impossible to do less, on paper.

— 328 —

But at four o’clock in the afternoon the voice of Duty rings 

less trumpet-toned:

“Well, I suppose we ought to be getting on.”
“Oh,  there’s  no  hurry!  don’t  fuss.  Lovely  view  from  here, 

“Very.  Don’t  forget  we  are  twenty-five  miles  from  St.  Bla-

isn’t it?”

sien.”

“How far?”
“Twenty-five miles, a little over if anything.”
“Do you mean to say we have only come thirty-five miles?”
“That’s all.”
“Nonsense. I don’t believe that map of yours.”
“It  is  impossible,  you  know. We  have  been  riding  steadily 

ever since the first thing this morning.”

“No,  we  haven’t.  We  didn’t  get  away  till  eight,  to  begin 

“Quarter to eight.”
“Well, quarter to eight; and every half-dozen miles we have 

“We have only stopped to look at the view. It’s no good com-

ing to see a country, and then not seeing it.”

“And we have had to pull up some stiff hills.”
“Besides, it has been an exceptionally hot day to-day.”
“Well, don’t forget St. Blasien is twenty-five miles off, that’s 

“Any more hills?”
“Yes, two; up and down.”
“I thought you said it was downhill into St. Blasien?”
“So it is for the last ten miles. We are twenty-five miles from 

St. Blasien here.”

“Isn’t there anywhere between here and St. Blasien? What’s 

that little place there on the lake?”

“It isn’t St. Blasien, or anywhere near it. There’s a danger in 

beginning that sort of thing.”

“There’s a danger in overworking oneself. One should study 

with.”

— 329 —

moderation  in  all  things.  Pretty  little  place,  that  Titisee,  ac-
cording to the map; looks as if there would be good air there.”
“All right, I’m agreeable. It was you fellows who suggested 

our making for St. Blasien.”

“Oh, I’m not so keen on St. Blasien! poky little place, down 
in a valley. This Titisee, I should say, was ever so much nicer.”

“Quite near, isn’t it?”
“Five miles.”
General chorus: “We’ll stop at Titisee.”
George  made  discovery  of  this  difference  between  theory 

and practice on the very first day of our ride.

“I thought,” said George — he was riding the single, Harris 
and I being a little ahead on the tandem — “that the idea was to 
train up the hills and ride down them.”

“So it is,” answered Harris, “as a general rule. But the trains 

don’t go up every hill in the Black Forest.”

“Somehow,  I  felt  a  suspicion  that  they  wouldn’t,”  growled 

George; and for a while silence reigned.

“Besides,” remarked Harris, who had evidently been rumi-
nating the subject, “you would not wish to have nothing but 
downhill, surely. It would not be playing the game. One must 
take a little rough with one’s smooth.”

Again  there  returned  silence,  broken  after  a  while  by 

George, this time.

account,” said George.

“Don’t you two fellows over-exert yourselves merely on my 

“How do you mean?” asked Harris.
“I mean,” answered George, “that where a train does happen 
to be going up these hills, don’t you put aside the idea of tak-
ing it for fear of outraging my finer feelings. Personally, I am 
prepared to go up all these hills in a railway train, even if it’s 
not playing the game. I’ll square the thing with my conscience; 
I’ve been up at seven every day for a week now, and I calculate 
it owes me a bit. Don’t you consider me in the matter at all.”

We  promised  to  bear  this  in  mind,  and  again  the  ride 

— 330 —

continued in dogged dumbness, until it was again broken by 
George.

“What bicycle did you say this was of yours?” asked George.
Harris told him. I forget of what particular manufacture it 

happened to be; it is immaterial.

“Are you sure?” persisted George.
“Of  course  I  am  sure,”  answered  Harris. “Why,  what’s  the 

“Well, it doesn’t come up to the poster,” said George, “that’s 

matter with it?”

all.”

“What poster?” asked Harris.
“The poster advertising this particular brand of cycle,” ex-
plained George. “I was looking at one on a hoarding in Sloane 
Street only a day or two before we started. A man was riding 
this  make  of  machine,  a  man  with  a  banner  in  his  hand:  he 
wasn’t doing any work, that was clear as daylight; he was just 
sitting on the thing and drinking in the air. The cycle was go-
ing of its own accord, and going well. This thing of yours leaves 
all the work to me. It is a lazy brute of a machine; if you don’t 
shove, it simply does nothing: I should complain about it, if I 
were you.”

When one comes to think of it, few bicycles do realise the 
poster. On only one poster that I can recollect have I seen the 
rider represented as doing any work. But then this man was 
being  pursued  by  a  bull.  In  ordinary  cases  the  object  of  the 
artist is to convince the hesitating neophyte that the sport of 
bicycling consists in sitting on a luxurious saddle, and being 
moved rapidly in the direction you wish to go by unseen heav-
enly powers.

Generally  speaking,  the  rider  is  a  lady,  and  then  one  feels 
that,  for  perfect  bodily  rest  combined  with  entire  freedom 
from mental anxiety, slumber upon a water-bed cannot com-
pare with bicycle-riding upon a hilly road. No fairy travelling 
on a summer cloud could take things more easily than does 
the bicycle girl, according to the poster. Her costume for cy-
cling in hot weather is ideal. Old-fashioned landladies might 

— 331 —

refuse her lunch, it is true; and a narrowminded police force 
might desire to secure her, and wrap her in a rug preliminary 
to summonsing her. But such she heeds not. Uphill and down-
hill, through traffic that might tax the ingenuity of a cat, over 
road surfaces calculated to break the average steam roller she 
passes,  a  vision  of  idle  loveliness;  her  fair  hair  streaming  to 
the wind, her sylph-like form poised airily, one foot upon the 
saddle,  the  other  resting  lightly  upon  the  lamp.  Sometimes 
she condescends to sit down on the saddle; then she puts her 
feet on the rests, lights a cigarette, and waves above her head a 
Chinese lantern.

Less often, it is a mere male thing that rides the machine. 
He is not so accomplished an acrobat as is the lady; but simple 
tricks, such as standing on the saddle and waving flags, drink-
ing  beer  or  beef-tea  while  riding,  he  can  and  does  perform. 
Something, one supposes, he must do to occupy his mind: sit-
ting still hour after hour on this machine, having no work to 
do, nothing to think about, must pall upon any man of active 
temperament. Thus it is that we see him rising on his pedals as 
he nears the top of some high hill to apostrophise the sun, or 
address poetry to the surrounding scenery.

Occasionally the poster pictures a pair of cyclists; and then 
one grasps the fact how much superior for purposes of flirta-
tion is the modern bicycle to the old-fashioned parlour or the 
played-out garden gate. He and she mount their bicycles, being 
careful, of course, that such are of the right make. After that 
they have nothing to think about but the old sweet tale. Down 
shady lanes, through busy towns on market days, merrily roll 
the  wheels  of  the “Bermondsey  Company’s  Bottom  Bracket 
Britain’s  Best,”  or  of  the  “Camberwell  Company’s  Jointless 
Eureka.”  They  need  no  pedalling;  they  require  no  guiding. 
Give them their heads, and tell them what time you want to 
get home, and that is all they ask. While Edwin leans from his 
saddle to whisper the dear old nothings in Angelina’s ear, while 
Angelina’s face, to hide its blushes, is turned towards the hori-
zon at the back, the magic bicycles pursue their even course.

— 332 —

And the sun is always shining and the roads are always dry. 
No stern parent rides behind, no interfering aunt beside, no 
demon small boy brother is peeping round the corner, there 
never comes a skid. Ah me! Why were there no “Britain’s Best” 
nor “Camberwell Eurekas” to be hired when we were young?

Or maybe the “Britain’s Best” or the “Camberwell Eureka” 
stands leaning against a gate; maybe it is tired. It has worked 
hard all the afternoon, carrying these young people. Mercifully 
minded,  they  have  dismounted,  to  give  the  machine  a  rest. 
They sit upon the grass beneath the shade of graceful boughs; 
it is long and dry grass. A stream flows by their feet. All is rest 
and peace.

That is ever the idea the cycle poster artist sets himself to 

convey — rest and peace.

But I am wrong in saying that no cyclist, according to the 
poster, ever works. Now I come to reflect, I have seen posters 
representing gentlemen on cycles working very hard — over-
working themselves, one might almost say. They are thin and 
haggard with the toil, the perspiration stands upon their brow 
in beads; you feel that if there is another hill beyond the poster 
they must either get off or die. But this is the result of their 
own folly. This happens because they will persist in riding a 
machine of an inferior make. Were they riding a “Putney Popu-
lar” or “Battersea Bounder,” such as the sensible young man in 
the centre of the poster rides, then all this unnecessary labour 
would be saved to them. Then all required of them would be, 
as in gratitude bound, to look happy; perhaps, occasionally to 
back-pedal a little when the machine in its youthful buoyancy 
loses its head for a moment and dashes on too swiftly.

You tired young men, sitting dejectedly on milestones, too 
spent  to  heed  the  steady  rain  that  soaks  you  through;  you 
weary  maidens,  with  the  straight,  damp  hair,  anxious  about 
the time, longing to swear, not knowing how; you stout bald 
men, vanishing visibly as you pant and grunt along the endless 
road; you purple, dejected matrons, plying with pain the slow 
unwilling wheel; why did you not see to it that you bought a 

— 333 —

“Britain’s Best” or a “Camberwell Eureka”? Why are these bi-
cycles of inferior make so prevalent throughout the land

Or is it with bicycling as with all other things: does Life at 

no point realise the Poster?

The  one  thing  in  Germany  that  never  fails  to  charm  and 
fascinate me is the German dog. In England one grows tired 
of the old breeds, one knows them all so well: the mastiff, the 
plum-pudding dog, the terrier (black, white or rough-haired, 
as  the  case  may  be,  but  always  quarrelsome),  the  collie,  the 
bulldog; never anything new. Now in Germany you get variety. 
You come across dogs the like of which you have never seen 
before:  that  until  you  hear  them  bark  you  do  not  know  are 
dogs. It is all so fresh, so interesting. George stopped a dog in 
Sigmaringen and drew our attention to it. It suggested a cross 
between a codfish and a poodle. I would not like to be positive 
it was not a cross between a codfish and a poodle. Harris tried 
to photograph it, but it ran up a fence and disappeared through 
some bushes.

I do not know what the German breeder’s idea is; at present 
he retains his secret. George suggests he is aiming at a griffin. 
There is much to bear out this theory, and indeed in one or two 
cases I have come across success on these lines would seem to 
have been almost achieved. Yet I cannot bring myself to believe 
that  such  are  anything  more  than  mere  accidents.  The  Ger-
man is practical, and I fail to see the object of a griffin. If mere 
quaintness of design be desired, is there not already the Dachs-
hund! What more is needed? Besides, about a house, a griffin 
would be so inconvenient: people would be continually tread-
ing on its tail. My own idea is that what the Germans are trying 
for is a mermaid, which they will then train to catch fish.

For your German does not encourage laziness in any living 
thing. He likes to see his dogs work, and the German dog loves 
work; of that there can be no doubt. The life of the English 
dog  must  be  a  misery  to  him.  Imagine  a  strong,  active,  and 
intelligent  being,  of  exceptionally  energetic  temperament, 
condemned  to  spend  twenty-four  hours  a  day  in  absolute 

— 334 —

idleness! How would you like it yourself? No wonder he feels 
misunderstood, yearns for the unattainable, and gets himself 
into trouble generally.

Now the German dog, on the other hand, has plenty to oc-
cupy  his  mind.  He  is  busy  and  important. Watch  him  as  he 
walks along harnessed to his milk cart. No churchwarden at 
collection time could feel or look more pleased with himself. 
He does not do any real work; the human being does the push-
ing, he does the barking; that is his idea of division of labour. 
What he says to himself is:

“The old man can’t bark, but he can shove. Very well.”
The interest and the pride he takes in the business is quite 
beautiful to see. Another dog passing by makes, maybe, some 
jeering remark, casting discredit upon the creaminess of the 
milk. He stops suddenly, quite regardless of the traffic.

“I  beg  your  pardon,  what  was  that  you  said  about  our 

“I said nothing about your milk,” retorts the other dog, in a 
tone of gentle innocence. “I merely said it was a fine day, and 
asked the price of chalk.”

“Oh, you asked the price of chalk, did you? Would you like 

“Yes, thanks; somehow I thought you would be able to tell 

“You are quite right, I can. It’s worth —”
“Oh, do come along!” says the old lady, who is tired and hot, 

and anxious to finish her round.

“Yes, but hang it all; did you hear what he hinted about our 

“Oh,  never  mind  him!  There’s  a  tram  coming  round  the 

corner: we shall all get run over.”

“Yes,  but  I  do  mind  him;  one  has  one’s  proper  pride.  He 
asked the price of chalk, and he’s going to know it! It’s worth 
just twenty times as much —”

“You’ll have the whole thing over, I know you will,” cries the 
old lady, pathetically, struggling with all her feeble strength to

milk?”

— 335 —

haul him back. “Oh dear, oh dear! I do wish I had left you at 
home.”

The tram is bearing down upon them; a cab-driver is shout-
ing at them; another huge brute, hoping to be in time to take a 
hand, is dragging a bread cart, followed by a screaming child, 
across the road from the opposite side; a small crowd is col-
lecting; and a policeman is hastening to the scene.

“It’s worth,” says the milk dog, “just twenty-times as much as 

you’ll be worth before I’ve done with you.”

“Oh, you think so, do you?”
“Yes, I do, you grandson of a French poodle, you cabbage-

eating —”

“There!  I  knew  you’d  have  it  over,”  says  the  poor  milk-

woman. “I told him he’d have it over.”

But he is busy, and heeds her not. Five minutes later, when 
the  traffic  is  renewed,  when  the  bread  girl  has  collected  her 
muddy rolls, and the policeman has gone off with the name 
and  address  of  everybody  in  the  street,  he  consents  to  look 
behind him.

“It is a bit of an upset,” he admits. Then shaking himself free 
of care, he adds, cheerfully, “But I guess I taught him the price 
of chalk. He won’t interfere with us again, I’m thinking.”

“I’m sure I hope not,” says the old lady, regarding dejectedly 

the milky road.

But his favourite sport is to wait at the top of the hill for 
another dog, and then race down. On these occasions the chief 
occupation of the other fellow is to run about behind, picking 
up the scattered articles, loaves, cabbages, or shirts, as they are 
jerked out. At the bottom of the hill, he stops and waits for his 
friend.

“Good race, wasn’t it?” he remarks, panting, as the Human 
comes up, laden to the chin. “I believe I’d have won it, too, if 
it hadn’t been for that fool of a small boy. He was right in my 
way just as I turned the corner. You noticed him? Wish I had, 
beastly brat! What’s he yelling like that for? Because I knocked 
him down and ran over him? Well, why didn’t he get out of the 

— 336 —

way? It’s disgraceful, the way people leave their children about 
for other people to tumble over. Halloa! did all those things 
come out? You couldn’t have packed them very carefully; you 
should see to a thing like that. You did not dream of my tear-
ing down the hill twenty miles an hour? Surely, you knew me 
better than to expect I’d let that old Schneider’s dog pass me 
without an effort. But there, you never think. You’re sure you’ve 
got them all? You believe so? I shouldn’t ‘believe’ if I were you; 
I  should  run  back  up  the  hill  again  and  make  sure.  You  feel 
too tired? Oh, all right! don’t blame me if anything is missing, 
that’s all.”

He is so self-willed. He is cock-sure that the correct turning 
is the second on the right, and nothing will persuade him that 
it is the third. He is positive he can get across the road in time, 
and will not be convinced until he sees the cart smashed up. 
Then he is very apologetic, it is true. But of what use is that? 
As he is usually of the size and strength of a young bull, and 
his human companion is generally a weak-kneed old man or 
woman, or a small child, he has his way. The greatest punish-
ment  his  proprietor  can  inflict  upon  him  is  to  leave  him  at 
home,  and  take  the  cart  out  alone.  But  your  German  is  too 
kind-hearted to do this often.

That he is harnessed to the cart for anybody’s pleasure but 
his own it is impossible to believe; and I am confident that the 
German peasant plans the tiny harness and fashions the little 
cart purely with the hope of gratifying his dog. In other coun-
tries — in  Belgium,  Holland  and  France — I  have  seen  these 
draught  dogs  ill-treated  and  over-worked;  but  in  Germany, 
never. Germans abuse animals shockingly. I have seen a Ger-
man stand in front of his horse and call it every name he could 
lay his tongue to. But the horse did not mind it. I have seen a 
German, weary with abusing his horse, call to his wife to come 
out and assist him. When she came, he told her what the horse 
had  done.  The  recital  roused  the  woman’s  temper  to  almost 
equal  heat  with  his  own;  and  standing  one  each  side  of  the 
poor beast, they both abused it. They abused its dead mother, 

— 337 —

they insulted its father; they made cutting remarks about its 
personal appearance, its intelligence, its moral sense, its gen-
eral ability as a horse. The animal bore the torrent with exem-
plary patience for awhile; then it did the best thing possible to 
do under the circumstances. Without losing its own temper, it 
moved quietly away. The lady returned to her washing, and the 
man followed it up the street, still abusing it.

A kinder-hearted people than the Germans there is no need 
for. Cruelty to animal or child is a thing almost unknown in 
the land. The whip with them is a musical instrument; its crack 
is heard from morning to night, but an Italian coachman that 
in  the  streets  of  Dresden  I  once  saw  use  it  was  very  nearly 
lynched by the indignant crowd. Germany is the only country 
in Europe where the traveller can settle himself comfortably 
in his hired carriage, confident that his gentle, willing friend 
between  the  shafts  will  be  neither  over-worked  nor  cruelly 
treated.

CHAPTER XI

Black  Forest  House:  and  the  sociability  therein — Its  perfume — 
George  positively  declines  to  remain  in  bed  after  four  o’clock  in 
the  morning — The  road  one  cannot  miss — My  peculiar  extra

English language abroad.

THERE was one night when, tired out and far from town or 
village, we slept in a Black Forest farmhouse. The great charm 
about the Black Forest house is its sociability. The cows are in 
the next room, the horses are upstairs, the geese and ducks are 
in the kitchen, while the pigs, the children, and the chickens 
live all over the place.

You are dressing, when you hear a grunt behind you.
“Good-morning! Don’t happen to have any potato peelings 

in here? No, I see you haven’t; good-bye.”

Next there is a cackle, and you see the neck of an old hen 

stretched round the corner.

“Fine  morning,  isn’t  it? You  don’t  mind  my  bringing  this 
worm of mine in here, do you? It is so difficult in this house 
to find a room where one can enjoy one’s food with any quiet-
ness. From a chicken I have always been a slow eater, and when 
a dozen — there, I thought they wouldn’t leave me alone. Now 
they’ll all want a bit. You don’t mind my getting on the bed, do 
you? Perhaps here they won’t notice me.”

While you are dressing various shock heads peer in at the 
door; they evidently regard the room as a temporary menag-
erie. You cannot tell whether the heads belong to boys or girls; 
you can only hope they are all male. It is of no use shutting 
the door, because there is nothing to fasten it by, and the mo-
ment you are gone they push it open again. You breakfast as 
the Prodigal Son is generally represented feeding: a pig or two 
drop in to keep you company; a party of elderly geese criticise 
you from the door; you gather from their whispers, added to 

— 339 —

their shocked expression, that they are talking scandal about 
you. Maybe a cow will condescend to give a glance in.

This Noah’s Ark arrangement it is, I suppose, that gives to 
the Black Forest home its distinctive scent. It is not a scent you 
can liken to any one thing. It is as if you took roses and Lim-
burger cheese and hair oil, some heather and onions, peaches 
and  soapsuds,  together  with  a  dash  of  sea  air  and  a  corpse, 
and mixed them up together. You cannot define any particular 
odour, but you feel they are all there — all the odours that the 
world has yet discovered. People who live in these houses are 
fond of this mixture. They do not open the window and lose 
any  of  it;  they  keep  it  carefully  bottled  up.  If  you  want  any 
other scent, you can go outside and smell the wood violets and 
the pines; inside there is the house; and after a while, I am told, 
you get used to it, so that you miss it, and are unable to go to 
sleep in any other atmosphere.

We had a long walk before us the next day, and it was our de-
sire, therefore, to get up early, even so early as six o’clock, if that 
could be managed without disturbing the whole household. We 
put it to our hostess whether she thought this could be done. 
She said she thought it could. She might not be about herself 
at that time; it was her morning for going into the town, some 
eight miles off, and she rarely got back much before seven; but, 
possibly, her husband or one of the boys would be returning 
home to lunch about that hour. Anyhow, somebody should be 
sent back to wake us and get our breakfast.

As it turned out, we did not need any waking. We got up at 
four, all by ourselves. We got up at four in order to get away 
from the noise and the din that was making our heads ache. 
What time the Black Forest peasant rises in the summer time I 
am unable to say; to us they appeared to be getting up all night. 
And the first thing the Black Forester does when he gets up is 
to put on a pair of stout boots with wooden soles, and take a 
constitutional round the house. Until he has been three times 
up and down the stairs, he does not feel he is up. Once fully 
awake himself, the next thing he does is to go upstairs to the 

— 340 —

stables, and wake up a horse. (The Black Forest house being 
built generally on the side of a steep hill, the ground floor is 
at the top, and the hay-loft at the bottom.) Then the horse, it 
would seem, must also have its constitutional round the house; 
and this seen to, the man goes downstairs into the kitchen and 
begins  to  chop  wood,  and  when  he  has  chopped  sufficient 
wood  he  feels  pleased  with  himself  and  begins  to  sing.  All 
things considered, we came to the conclusion we could not do 
better than follow the excellent example set us. Even George 
was quite eager to get up that morning.

We had a frugal breakfast at half-past four, and started away 
at five. Our road lay over a mountain, and from enquiries made 
in the village it appeared to be one of those roads you cannot 
possibly  miss.  I  suppose  everybody  knows  this  sort  of  road. 
Generally,  it  leads  you  back  to  where  you  started  from;  and 
when it doesn’t, you wish it did, so that at all events you might 
know where you were. I foresaw evil from the very first, and 
before we had accomplished a couple of miles we came up with 
it. The road divided into three. A worm-eaten sign-post indi-
cated that the path to the left led to a place that we had never 
heard of — that was on no map. Its other arm, pointing out the 
direction of the middle road, had disappeared. The road to the 
right, so we all agreed, clearly led back again to the village.

“The old man said distinctly,” so Harris reminded us, “keep 

straight on round the hill.”

“Which hill?” George asked, pertinently.
We  were  confronted  by  half  a  dozen,  some  of  them  big, 

some of them little.

wood.”

ever road we take.”

“He told us,” continued Harris, “that we should come to a 

“I see no reason to doubt him,” commented George, “which-

As a matter of fact, a dense wood covered every hill.
“And he said,” murmured Harris, “that we should reach the 

top in about an hour and a half.”

“There it is,” said George, “that I begin to disbelieve him.”

— 341 —

“Well, what shall we do?” said Harris.
Now I happen to possess the bump of locality. It is not a vir-
tue; I make no boast of it. It is merely an animal instinct that I 
cannot help. That things occasionally get in my way — moun-
tains, precipices, rivers, and such like obstructions — is no fault 
of mine. My instinct is correct enough; it is the earth that is 
wrong. I led them by the middle road. That the middle road 
had not character enough to continue for any quarter of a mile 
in the same direction; that after three miles up and down hill 
it ended abruptly in a wasps’ nest, was not a thing that should 
have  been  laid  to  my  door.  If  the  middle  road  had  gone  in 
the direction it ought to have done, it would have taken us to 
where we wanted to go, of that I am convinced.

Even  as  it  was,  I  would  have  continued  to  use  this  gift  of 
mine to discover a fresh way had a proper spirit been displayed 
towards me. But I am not an angel — I admit this frankly, — and 
I decline to exert myself for the ungrateful and the ribald. Be-
sides, I doubt if George and Harris would have followed me 
further in any event. Therefore it was that I washed my hands 
of the whole affair, and that Harris entered upon the vacancy.
“Well,” said Harris. “I suppose you are satisfied with what 

you have done?”

“I am quite satisfied,” I replied from the heap of stones where 
I was sitting. “So far, I have brought you with safety. I would 
continue to lead you further, but no artist can work without 
encouragement. You appear dissatisfied with me because you 
do not know where you are. For all you know, you may be just 
where you want to be. But I say nothing as to that; I expect no 
thanks. Go your own way; I have done with you both.”

I spoke, perhaps, with bitterness, but I could not help it. Not 

a word of kindness had I had all the weary way.

“Do not misunderstand us,” said Harris; “both George and 
myself  feel  that  without  your  assistance  we  should  never  be 
where we now are. For that we give you every credit. But in-
stinct is liable to error. What I propose to do is to substitute for 
it Science, which is exact. Now, where’s the sun?”

— 342 —

“Don’t  you  think,”  said  George, “that  if  we  made  our  way 
back to the village, and hired a boy for a mark to guide us, it 
would save time in the end?”

“It would be wasting hours,” said Harris, with decision. “You 
leave this to me. I have been reading about this thing, and it 
has interested me.” He took out his watch, and began turning 
himself round and round.

“It’s as simple as ABC,” he continued. “You point the short 
hand at the sun, then you bisect the segment between the short 
hand and the twelve, and thus you get the north.”

He worried up and down for a while, then he fixed it.
“Now I’ve got it,” he said; “that’s the north, where that wasps’ 

nest is. Now give me the map.”

We handed it to him, and seating himself facing the wasps, 

he examined it.

“Todtmoos from here,” he said, “is south by south-west.”
“How do you mean, from here?” asked George.
“Why, from here, where we are,” returned Harris.
“But where are we?” said George.
This worried Harris for a time, but at length he cheered up.
“It doesn’t matter where we are,” he said. “Wherever we are, 
Todtmoos is south by south-west. Come on, we are only wast-
ing time.”

“I don’t quite see how you make it out,” said George, as he 
rose  and  shouldered  his  knapsack; “but  I  suppose  it  doesn’t 
matter. We are out for our health, and it’s all pretty!”

“We shall be all right,” said Harris, with cheery confidence. 
“We shall be in at Todtmoos before ten, don’t you worry. And 
at Todtmoos we will have something to eat.”

He said that he, himself, fancied a beefsteak, followed by an 
omelette. George said that, personally, he intended to keep his 
mind off the subject until he saw Todtmoos.

We walked for half an hour, then emerging upon an open-
ing, we saw below us, about two miles away, the village through 
which we had passed that morning. It had a quaint church with 
an outside staircase, a somewhat unusual arrangement.

— 343 —

The  sight  of  it  made  me  sad. We  had  been  walking  hard 
for three hours and a half, and had accomplished, apparently, 
about four miles. But Harris was delighted.

“Now, at last,” said Harris, “we know where we are.”
“I thought you said it didn’t matter,” George reminded him.
“No more it does, practically,” replied Harris, “but it is just 

as well to be certain. Now I feel more confidence in myself.”

“I’m not so sure about that being an advantage,” muttered 

George. But I do not think Harris heard him.

“We are now,” continued Harris, “east of the sun, and Todt-

moos is south-west of where we are. So that if —”

He broke off. “By-the-by,” he said, “do you remember wheth-
er I said the bisecting line of that segment pointed to the north 
or to the south?”

“You said it pointed to the north,” replied George.
“Are you positive?” persisted Harris.
“Positive,”  answered  George  “but  don’t  let  that  influence 

your calculations. In all probability you were wrong.”
Harris thought for a while; then his brow cleared.
“That’s all right,” he said; “of course, it’s the north. It must be 
the north. How could it be the south? Now we must make for 
the west. Come on.”

“I am quite willing to make for the west,” said George; “any 
point of the compass is the same to me. I only wish to remark 
that, at the present moment, we are going dead east.”

“No we are not,” returned Harris; “we are going west.”
“We are going east, I tell you,” said George.
“I  wish  you  wouldn’t  keep  saying  that,”  said  Harris, “you 

confuse me.”

“I don’t mind if I do,” returned George; “I would rather do 

that than go wrong. I tell you we are going dead east.”
“What nonsense!” retorted Harris; “there’s the sun.”
“I  can  see  the  sun,”  answered  George, “quite  distinctly.  It 
may  be  where  it  ought  to  be,  according  to  you  and  Science, 
or it may not. All I know is, that when we were down in the 
village, that particular hill with that particular lump of rock 

— 344 —

upon it was due north of us. At the present moment we are 
facing due east.”

“You are quite right,” said Harris; “I forgot for the moment 

that we had turned round.”

“I should get into the habit of making a note of it, if I were 
you,” grumbled George; “it’s a manoeuvre that will probably 
occur again more than once.”

We faced about, and walked in the other direction. At the 
end  of  forty  minutes’  climbing  we  again  emerged  upon  an 
opening, and again the village lay just under our feet. On this 
occasion it was south of us.

“This is very extraordinary,” said Harris.
“I  see  nothing  remarkable  about  it,”  said  George. “If  you 
walk steadily round a village it is only natural that now and 
then you get a glimpse of it. Myself, I am glad to see it. It proves 
to me that we are not utterly lost.”

“It ought to be the other side of us,” said Harris.
“It will be in another hour or so,” said George, “if we keep 

on.”

I said little myself; I was vexed with both of them; but I was 
glad to notice George evidently growing cross with Harris. It 
was  absurd  of  Harris  to  fancy  he  could  find  the  way  by  the 
sun.

“I wish I knew,” said Harris, thoughtfully, “for certain wheth-

er that bisecting line points to the north or to the south.”

“I should make up my mind about it,” said George; “it’s an 

important point.”

you why.”

believe it isn’t.”

“It’s impossible it can be the north,” said Harris, “and I’ll tell 

“You needn’t trouble,” said George; “I am quite prepared to 

“You said just now it was,” said Harris, reproachfully.
“I said nothing of the sort,” retorted George. “I said you said 
it was — a very different thing. If you think it isn’t, let’s go the 
other way. It’ll be a change, at all events.”

So Harris worked things out according to the contrary cal-

— 345 —

culation, and again we plunged into the wood; and again after 
half an hour’s stiff climbing we came in view of that same vil-
lage. True, we were a little higher, and this time it lay between 
us and the sun.

“I think,” said George, as he stood looking down at it, “this 
is the best view we’ve had of it, as yet. There is only one other 
point  from  which  we  can  see  it. After  that,  I  propose  we  go 
down into it and get some rest.”

“I  don’t  believe  it’s  the  same  village,”  said  Harris; “it  can’t 

be.”

“There’s no mistaking that church,” said George. “But may-
be it is a case on all fours with that Prague statue. Possibly, the 
authorities hereabout have had made some life-sized models 
of  that  village,  and  have  stuck  them  about  the  Forest  to  see 
where the thing would look best. Anyhow, which way do we 
go now?”

“I don’t know,” said Harris, “and I don’t care. I have done my 

best; you’ve done nothing but grumble, and confuse me.”

“I may have been critical,” admitted George “but look at the 
thing from my point of view. One of you says he’s got an in-
stinct, and leads me to a wasps’ nest in the middle of a wood.”

“I can’t help wasps building in a wood,” I replied.
“I don’t say you can,” answered George. “I am not arguing; 
I am merely stating incontrovertible facts. The other one, who 
leads me up and down hill for hours on scientific principles, 
doesn’t know the north from the south, and is never quite sure 
whether he’s turned round or whether he hasn’t. Personally, I 
profess to no instincts beyond the ordinary, nor am I a scien-
tist. But two fields off I can see a man. I am going to offer him 
the worth of the hay he is cutting, which I estimate at one mark 
fifty pfennig, to leave his work, and lead me to within sight of 
Todtmoos. If you two fellows like to follow, you can. If not, you 
can start another system and work it out by yourselves.”

George’s  plan  lacked  both  originality  and  aplomb,  but  at 
the  moment  it  appealed  to  us.  Fortunately,  we  had  worked 
round to a very short distance away from the spot where we 

— 346 —

had originally gone wrong; with the result that, aided by the 
gentleman of the scythe, we recovered the road, and reached 
Todtmoos four hours later than we had calculated to reach it, 
with an appetite that took forty-five minutes’ steady work in 
silence to abate.

From  Todtmoos  we  had  intended  to  walk  down  to  the 
Rhine; but having regard to our extra exertions of the morn-
ing,  we  decided  to  promenade  in  a  carriage,  as  the  French 
would say: and for this purpose hired a picturesque-looking 
vehicle,  drawn  by  a  horse  that  I  should  have  called  barrel-
bodied  but  for  contrast  with  his  driver,  in  comparison  with 
whom he was angular. In Germany every vehicle is arranged 
for a pair of horses, but drawn generally by one. This gives to 
the equipage a lop-sided appearance, according to our notions, 
but it is held here to indicate style. The idea to be conveyed is 
that you usually drive a pair of horses, but that for the moment 
you have mislaid the other one. The German driver is not what 
we should call a first-class whip. He is at his best when he is 
asleep. Then, at all events, he is harmless; and the horse be-
ing, generally speaking, intelligent and experienced, progress 
under  these  conditions  is  comparatively  safe.  If  in  Germany 
they could only train the horse to collect the money at the end 
of the journey, there would be no need for a coachman at all. 
This would be a distinct relief to the passenger, for when the 
German coachman is awake and not cracking his whip he is 
generally  occupied  in  getting  himself  into  trouble  or  out  of 
it.  He  is  better  at  the  former.  Once  I  recollect  driving  down 
a steep Black Forest hill with a couple of ladies. It was one of 
those roads winding corkscrew-wise down the slope. The hill 
rose at an angle of seventy-five on the off-side, and fell away at 
an angle of seventy-five on the near-side. We were proceeding 
very comfortably, the driver, we were happy to notice, with his 
eyes shut, when suddenly something, a bad dream or indiges-
tion, awoke him. He seized the reins, and, by an adroit move-
ment, pulled the near-side horse over the edge, where it clung, 
half supported by the traces. Our driver did not appear in the 

— 347 —

least annoyed or surprised; both horses, I also, noticed, seemed 
equally used to the situation. We got out, and he got down. He 
took  from  under  the  seat  a  huge  clasp-knife,  evidently  kept 
there for the purpose, and deftly cut the traces. The horse, thus 
released, rolled over and over until he struck the road again 
some  fifty  feet  below.  There  he  regained  his  feet  and  stood 
waiting for us. We re-entered the carriage and descended with 
the single horse until we came to him. There, with the help of 
some  bits  of  string,  our  driver  harnessed  him  again,  and  we 
continued  on  our  way. What  impressed  me  was  the  evident 
accustomedness of both driver and horses to this method of 
working down a hill.

Evidently to them it appeared a short and convenient cut. 
I should not have been surprised had the man suggested our 
strapping ourselves in, and then rolling over and over, carriage 
and all, to the bottom.

Another  peculiarity  of  the  German  coachman  is  that  he 
never attempts to pull in or to pull up. He regulates his rate 
of speed, not by the pace of the horse, but by manipulation of 
the brake. For eight miles an hour he puts it on slightly, so that 
it only scrapes the wheel, producing a continuous sound as of 
the sharpening of a saw; for four miles an hour he screws it 
down harder, and you travel to an accompaniment of groans 
and shrieks, suggestive of a symphony of dying pigs. When he 
desires to come to a full stop, he puts it on to its full. If his 
brake be a good one, he calculates he can stop his carriage, un-
less the horse be an extra powerful animal, in less than twice 
its  own  length.  Neither  the  German  driver  nor  the  German 
horse knows, apparently, that you can stop a carriage by any 
other method. The German horse continues to pull with his 
full strength until he finds it impossible to move the vehicle 
another inch; then he rests. Horses of other countries are quite 
willing  to  stop  when  the  idea  is  suggested  to  them.  I  have 
known horses content to go even quite slowly. But your Ger-
man horse, seemingly, is built for one particular speed, and is 
unable to depart from it. I am stating nothing but the literal, 

— 348 —

unadorned truth, when I say I have seen a German coachman, 
with the reins lying loose over the splash-board, working his 
brake with both hands, in terror lest he would not be in time 
to avoid a collision.

At  Waldshut,  one  of  those  little  sixteenth-century  towns 
through  which  the  Rhine  flows  during  its  earlier  course,  we 
came  across  that  exceedingly  common  object  of  the  Conti-
nent: the travelling Briton grieved and surprised at the unac-
quaintance of the foreigner with the subtleties of the English 
language.  When  we  entered  the  station  he  was,  in  very  fair 
English, though with a slight Somersetshire accent, explaining 
to a porter for the tenth time, as he informed us, the simple fact 
that though he himself had a ticket for Donaueschingen, and 
wanted to go to Donaueschingen, to see the source of the Dan-
ube, which is not there, though they tell you it is, he wished his 
bicycle to be sent on to Engen and his bag to Constance, there 
to await his arrival. He was hot and angry with the effort of the 
thing. The porter was a young man in years, but at the moment 
looked old and miserable. I offered my services. I wish now I 
had not — though not so fervently, I expect, as he, the speech-
less one, came subsequently to wish this. All three routes, so 
the  porter  explained  to  us,  were  complicated,  necessitating 
changing and re-changing. There was not much time for calm 
elucidation, as our own train was starting in a few minutes. The 
man  himself  was  voluble — always  a  mistake  when  anything 
entangled has to be made clear; while the porter was only too 
eager to get the job done with and so breathe again. It dawned 
upon me ten minutes later, when thinking the matter over in 
the train, that though I had agreed with the porter that it would 
be best for the bicycle to go by way of Immendingen, and had 
agreed to his booking it to Immendingen, I had neglected to 
give instructions for its departure from Immendingen. Were I 
of a despondent temperament I should be worrying myself at 
the present moment with the reflection that in all probability 
that bicycle is still at Immendingen to this day. But I regard it 
as  good  philosophy  to  endeavour  always  to  see  the  brighter 

— 349 —

side of things. Possibly the porter corrected my omission on 
his own account, or some simple miracle may have happened 
to restore that bicycle to its owner some time before the end 
of his tour. The bag we sent to Radolfzell: but here I console 
myself  with  the  recollection  that  it  was  labelled  Constance; 
and no doubt after a while the railway authorities, finding it 
unclaimed at Radolfzell, forwarded it on to Constance.

But all this is apart from the moral I wished to draw from 
the incident. The true inwardness of the situation lay in the in-
dignation of this Britisher at finding a German railway porter 
unable to comprehend English. The moment we spoke to him 
he expressed this indignation in no measured terms.

“Thank you very much indeed,” he said; “it’s simple enough. 
I want to go to Donaueschingen myself by train; from Donau-
eschingen I am going to walk to Geisengen; from Geisengen 
I am going to take the train to Engen, and from Engen I am 
going to bicycle to Constance. But I don’t want to take my bag 
with me; I want to find it at Constance when I get there. I have 
been  trying  to  explain  the  thing  to  this  fool  for  the  last  ten 
minutes; but I can’t get it into him.”

“It  is  very  disgraceful,”  I  agreed. “Some  of  these  German 

workmen know hardly any other language than their own.”

“I have gone over it with him,” continued the man, “on the 
time table, and explained it by pantomime. Even then I could 
not knock it into him.”

“I  can  hardly  believe  you,”  I  again  remarked; “you  would 

think the thing explained itself.”

Harris was angry with the man; he wished to reprove him 
for his folly in journeying through the outlying portions of a 
foreign clime, and seeking in such to accomplish complicated 
railway  tricks  without  knowing  a  word  of  the  language  of 
the  country.  But  I  checked  the  impulsiveness  of  Harris,  and 
pointed out to him the great and good work at which the man 
was unconsciously assisting.

Shakespeare and Milton may have done their little best to 
spread acquaintance with the English tongue among the less 

— 350 —

favoured  inhabitants  of  Europe.  Newton  and  Darwin  may 
have rendered their language a necessity among educated and 
thoughtful foreigners. Dickens and Ouida (for your folk who 
imagine that the literary world is bounded by the prejudices 
of  New  Grub  Street,  would  be  surprised  and  grieved  at  the 
position  occupied  abroad  by  this  at-home-sneered-at  lady) 
may have helped still further to popularise it. But the man who 
has spread the knowledge of English from Cape St. Vincent to 
the Ural Mountains is the Englishman who, unable or unwill-
ing to learn a single word of any language but his own, travels 
purse  in  hand  into  every  corner  of  the  Continent.  One  may 
be  shocked  at  his  ignorance,  annoyed  at  his  stupidity,  angry 
at  his  presumption.  But  the  practical  fact  remains;  he  it  is 
that is anglicising Europe. For him the Swiss peasant tramps 
through  the  snow  on  winter  evenings  to  attend  the  English 
class  open  in  every  village.  For  him  the  coachman  and  the 
guard,  the  chambermaid  and  the  laundress,  pore  over  their 
English grammars and colloquial phrase books. For him the 
foreign shopkeeper and merchant send their sons and daugh-
ters in their thousands to study in every English town. For him 
it  is  that  every  foreign  hotel-  and  restaurant-keeper  adds  to 
his advertisement: “Only those with fair knowledge of English 
need apply.”

Did the English-speaking races make it their rule to speak 
anything  else  than  English,  the  marvellous  progress  of  the 
English tongue throughout the world would stop. The English-
speaking man stands amid the strangers and jingles his gold.
“Here,” cries, “is payment for all such as can speak English.”
He  it  is  who  is  the  great  educator.  Theoretically  we  may 
scold him; practically we should take our hats off to him. He is 
the missionary of the English tongue.

We are grieved at the earthly instincts of the German — A superb

A THING that vexes much the high-class Anglo-Saxon soul is 
the earthly instinct prompting the German to fix a restaurant 
at the goal of every excursion. On mountain summit, in fairy 
glen,  on  lonely  pass,  by  waterfall  or  winding  stream,  stands 
ever the busy Wirtschaft. How can one rhapsodise over a view 
when surrounded by beer-stained tables? How lose one’s self in 
historical reverie amid the odour of roast veal and spinach?

One day, on elevating thoughts intent, we climbed through 

tangled woods.

“And at the top,” said Harris, bitterly, as we paused to breathe 
a space and pull our belts a hole tighter, “there will be a gaudy 
restaurant, where people will be guzzling beefsteaks and plum 
tarts and drinking white wine.”

“Do you think so?” said George.
“Sure to be,” answered Harris; “you know their way. Not one 
grove  will  they  consent  to  dedicate  to  solitude  and  contem-
plation; not one height will they leave to the lover of nature 
unpolluted by the gross and the material.”

“I calculate,” I remarked, “that we shall be there a little be-

fore one o’clock, provided we don’t dawdle.”

“The ‘mittagstisch’ will be just ready,” groaned Harris, “with 
possibly some of those little blue trout they catch about here. 
In Germany one never seems able to get away from food and 
drink. It is maddening!”

We pushed on, and in the beauty of the walk forgot our in-

dignation. My estimate proved to be correct.

— 352 —

At a quarter to one, said Harris, who was leading:
“Here we are; I can see the summit.”
“Any sign of that restaurant?” said George.
“I don’t notice it,” replied Harris; “but it’s there, you may be 

sure; confound it!”

Five minutes later we stood upon the top. We looked north, 

south, east and west; then we looked at one another.

“Grand view, isn’t it?” said Harris.
“Magnificent,” I agreed.
“Superb,” remarked George.
“They have had the good sense for once,” said Harris, “to 

put that restaurant out of sight.”

“They do seem to have hidden it,” said George. “One doesn’t 
mind  the  thing  so  much  when  it  is  not  forced  under  one’s 
nose,” said Harris.

“Of  course,  in  its  place,”  I  observed, “a  restaurant  is  right 

enough.”

“I should like to know where they have put it,” said George.
“Suppose we look for it?” said Harris, with inspiration.
It seemed a good idea. I felt curious myself. We agreed to 
explore  in  different  directions,  returning  to  the  summit  to 
report progress. In half an hour we stood together once again. 
There  was  no  need  for  words.  The  face  of  one  and  all  of  us 
announced plainly that at last we had discovered a recess of 
German nature untarnished by the sordid suggestion of food 
or drink.

“I  should  never  have  believed  it  possible,”  said  Harris: 

“would you?”

out an effort.”

“I should say,” I replied, “that this is the only square quarter 

of a mile in the entire Fatherland unprovided with one.”

“And we three strangers have struck it,” said George, “with-

“True,”  I  observed.  “By  pure  good  fortune  we  are  now 
enabled to feast our finer senses undisturbed by appeal to our 
lower nature. Observe the light upon those distant peaks; is it 
not ravishing?”

— 353 —

“Talking of nature,” said George, “which should you say was 

the nearest way down?”

“The road to the left,” I replied, after consulting the guide 
book, “takes us to Sonnensteig — where, by-the-by, I observe 
the ‘Goldener Adler’ is well spoken of — in about two hours. 
The  road  to  the  right,  though  somewhat  longer,  commands 
more extensive prospects.”

“One  prospect,”  said  Harris,  “is  very  much  like  another 

prospect; don’t you think so?”

“Personally,”  said  George,  “I  am  going  by  the  left-hand 

road.” And Harris and I went after him.

But we were not to get down so soon as we had anticipated. 
Storms  come  quickly  in  these  regions,  and  before  we  had 
walked for quarter of an hour it became a question of seeking 
shelter or living for the rest of the day in soaked clothes. We 
decided on the former alternative, and selected a tree that, un-
der ordinary circumstances, should have been ample protec-
tion. But a Black Forest thunderstorm is not an ordinary cir-
cumstance. We consoled ourselves at first by telling each other 
that at such a rate it could not last long. Next, we endeavoured 
to comfort ourselves with the reflection that if it did we should 
soon be too wet to fear getting wetter.

“As it turned out,” said Harris, “I should have been almost 

glad if there had been a restaurant up here.”

“I  see  no  advantage  in  being  both  wet  and  hungry,”  said 
George. “I shall give it another five minutes, then I am going 
on.”

“These mountain solitudes,” I remarked, “are very attractive 
in fine weather. On a rainy day, especially if you happen to be 
past the age when —”

At this point there hailed us a voice, proceeding from a stout 
gentleman, who stood some fifty feet away from us under a big 
umbrella.

“Won’t you come inside?” asked the stout gentleman.
“Inside where?” I called back. I thought at first he was one 

— 354 —

of those fools that will try to be funny when there is nothing 
to be funny about.

“Inside the restaurant,” he answered.
We left our shelter and made for him. We wished for further 

information about this thing.

“I did call to you from the window,” said the stout gentle-
man, as we drew near to him, “but I suppose you did not hear 
me.  This  storm  may  last  for  another  hour;  you  will  get  so 
wet.”

He  was  a  kindly  old  gentleman;  he  seemed  quite  anxious 

about us.

I said: “It is very kind of you to have come out. We are not 
lunatics. We have not been standing under that tree for the last 
half-hour knowing all the time there was a restaurant, hidden 
by the trees, within twenty yards of us. We had no idea we were 
anywhere near a restaurant.”

“I thought maybe you hadn’t,” said the old gentleman; “that 

is why I came.”

It appeared that all the people in the inn had been watching 
us from the windows also, wondering why we stood there look-
ing miserable. If it had not been for this nice old gentleman the 
fools would have remained watching us, I suppose, for the rest 
of the afternoon. The landlord excused himself by saying he 
thought we looked like English. It is no figure of speech. On 
the Continent they do sincerely believe that every Englishman 
is mad. They are as convinced of it as is every English peasant 
that Frenchmen live on frogs. Even when one makes a direct 
personal effort to disabuse them of the impression one is not 
always successful.

It  was  a  comfortable  little  restaurant,  where  they  cooked 
well, while the Tischwein was really most passable. We stopped 
there for a couple of hours, and dried ourselves and fed our-
selves, and talked about the view; and just before we left an 
incident occurred that shows how much more stirring in this 
world are the influences of evil compared with those of good.
A traveller entered. He seemed a careworn man. He carried 

— 355 —

a brick in his hand, tied to a piece of rope. He entered nerv-
ously and hurriedly, closed the door carefully behind him, saw 
to it that it was fastened, peered out of the window long and 
earnestly, and then, with a sigh of relief, laid his brick upon the 
bench beside him and called for food and drink.

There  was  something  mysterious  about  the  whole  affair. 
One wondered what he was going to do with the brick, why 
he  had  closed  the  door  so  carefully,  why  he  had  looked  so 
anxiously from the window; but his aspect was too wretched 
to invite conversation, and we forbore, therefore, to ask him 
questions. As he ate and drank he grew more cheerful, sighed 
less often. Later he stretched his legs, lit an evil-smelling cigar, 
and puffed in calm contentment.

Then it happened. It happened too suddenly for any detailed 
explanation of the thing to be possible. I recollect a Fraulein 
entering the room from the kitchen with a pan in her hand. I 
saw her cross to the outer door. The next moment the whole 
room  was  in  an  uproar.  One  was  reminded  of  those  panto-
mime  transformation  scenes  where,  from  among  floating 
clouds, slow music, waving flowers, and reclining fairies, one 
is suddenly transported into the midst of shouting policemen 
tumbling  yelling  babies,  swells  fighting  pantaloons,  sausages 
and harlequins, buttered slides and clowns. As the Fraulein of 
the pan touched the door it flew open, as though all the spir-
its of sin had been pressed against it, waiting. Two pigs and a 
chicken rushed into the room; a cat that had been sleeping on 
a beer-barrel spluttered into fiery life. The Fraulein threw her 
pan into the air and lay down on the floor. The gentleman with 
the brick sprang to his feet, upsetting the table before him with 
everything upon it.

One looked to see the cause of this disaster: one discovered 
it at once in the person of a mongrel terrier with pointed ears 
and  a  squirrel’s  tail.  The  landlord  rushed  out  from  another 
door, and attempted to kick him out of the room. Instead, he 
kicked one of the pigs, the fatter of the two. It was a vigorous, 
well-planted kick, and the pig got the whole of it; none of it 

— 356 —

was wasted. One felt sorry for the poor animal; but no amount 
of sorrow anyone else might feel for him could compare with 
the sorrow he felt for himself. He stopped running about; he 
sat down in the middle of the room, and appealed to the solar 
system  generally  to  observe  this  unjust  thing  that  had  come 
upon him. They must have heard his complaint in the valleys 
round about, and have wondered what upheaval of nature was 
taking place among the hills.

As for the hen it scuttled, screaming, every way at once. It 
was a marvellous bird: it seemed to be able to run up a straight 
wall  quite  easily;  and  it  and  the  cat  between  them  fetched 
down mostly everything that was not already on the floor. In 
less than forty seconds there were nine people in that room, all 
trying to kick one dog. Possibly, now and again, one or another 
may have succeeded, for occasionally the dog would stop bark-
ing in order to howl. But it did not discourage him. Everything 
has to be paid for, he evidently argued, even a pig and chicken 
hunt; and, on the whole, the game was worth it.

Besides, he had the satisfaction of observing that, for every 
kick he received, most other living things in the room got two. 
As for the unfortunate pig — the stationary one, the one that 
still sat lamenting in the centre of the room — he must have 
averaged a steady four. Trying to kick this dog was like playing 
football with a ball that was never there — not when you went 
to kick it, but after you had started to kick it, and had gone too 
far to stop yourself, so that the kick had to go on in any case, 
your only hope being that your foot would find something or 
another solid to stop it, and so save you from sitting down on 
the floor noisily and completely. When anybody did kick the 
dog it was by pure accident, when they were not expecting to 
kick him; and, generally speaking, this took them so unawares 
that, after kicking him, they fell over him. And everybody, eve-
ry half-minute, would be certain to fall over the pig the sitting 
pig, the one incapable of getting out of anybody’s way.

How long the scrimmage might have lasted it is impossible 
to say. It was ended by the judgment of George. For a while 

— 357 —

he had been seeking to catch, not the dog but the remaining 
pig,  the  one  still  capable  of  activity.  Cornering  it  at  last,  he 
persuaded it to cease running round and round the room, and 
instead to take a spin outside. It shot through the door with 
one long wail.

We always desire the thing we have not. One pig, a chicken, 
nine people, and a cat, were as nothing in that dog’s opinion 
compared with the quarry that was disappearing. Unwisely, he 
darted after it, and George closed the door upon him and shot 
the bolt.

Then the landlord stood up, and surveyed all the things that 

were lying on the floor.

come in with the brick.

“That’s a playful dog of yours,” said he to the man who had 

“He is not my dog,” replied the man sullenly.
“Whose dog is it then?” said the landlord.
“I don’t know whose dog it is,” answered the man.
“That won’t do for me, you know,” said the landlord, picking 
up a picture of the German Emperor, and wiping beer from it 
with his sleeve.

“I  know  it  won’t,”  replied  the  man;  “I  never  expected  it 
would. I’m tired of telling people it isn’t my dog. They none of 
them believe me.”

“What do you want to go about with him for, if he’s not your 

dog?” said the landlord. “What’s the attraction about him?”

“I don’t go about with him,” replied the man; “he goes about 
with me. He picked me up this morning at ten o’clock, and he 
won’t leave me. I thought I had got rid of him when I came in 
here. I left him busy killing a duck more than a quarter of an 
hour away. I’ll have to pay for that, I expect, on my way back.”

“Have you tried throwing stones at him?” asked Harris.
“Have  I  tried  throwing  stones  at  him!”  replied  the  man, 
contemptuously.  “I’ve  been  throwing  stones  at  him  till  my 
arm aches with throwing stones; and he thinks it’s a game, and 
brings them back to me. I’ve been carrying this beastly brick 
about with me for over an hour, in the hope of being able to 

— 358 —

drown  him,  but  he  never  comes  near  enough  for  me  to  get 
hold of him. He just sits six inches out of reach with his mouth 
open, and looks at me.”

“It’s the funniest story I’ve heard for a long while,” said the 

landlord.

“Glad it amuses somebody,” said the man.
We  left  him  helping  the  landlord  to  pick  up  the  broken 
things, and went our way. A dozen yards outside the door the 
faithful animal was waiting for his friend. He looked tired, but 
contented. He was evidently a dog of strange and sudden fan-
cies, and we feared for the moment lest he might take a liking 
to us. But he let us pass with indifference. His loyalty to this 
unresponsive man was touching; and we made no attempt to 
undermine it.

Having completed to our satisfaction the Black Forest, we 
journeyed on our wheels through Alt Breisach and Colmar to 
Münster;  whence  we  started  a  short  exploration  of  the Vos-
ges range, where, according to the present German Emperor, 
humanity stops. Of old, Alt Breisach, a rocky fortress with the 
river now on one side of it and now on the other — for in its 
inexperienced youth the Rhine never seems to have been quite 
sure of its way, — must, as a place of residence, have appealed 
exclusively to the lover of change and excitement. Whoever the 
war was between, and whatever it was about, Alt Breisach was 
bound to be in it. Everybody besieged it, most people captured 
it; the majority of them lost it again; nobody seemed able to 
keep it. Whom he belonged to, and what he was, the dweller 
in Alt Breisach could never have been quite sure. One day he 
would be a Frenchman, and then before he could learn enough 
French to pay his taxes he would be an Austrian. While try-
ing to discover what you did in order to be a good Austrian, 
he would find he was no longer an Austrian, but a German, 
though what particular German out of the dozen must always 
have been doubtful to him. One day he would discover that he 
was a Catholic, the next an ardent Protestant. The only thing 
that could have given any stability to his existence must have 

— 359 —

been the monotonous necessity of paying heavily for the privi-
lege of being whatever for the moment he was. But when one 
begins  to  think  of  these  things  one  finds  oneself  wondering 
why anybody in the Middle Ages, except kings and tax collec-
tors, ever took the trouble to live at all.

For  variety  and  beauty,  the Vosges  will  not  compare  with 
the  hills  of  the  Schwarzwald.  The  advantage  about  them 
from the tourist’s point of view is their superior poverty. The 
Vosges peasant has not the unromantic air of contented pros-
perity  that  spoils  his  vis-a-vis  across  the  Rhine.  The  villages 
and  farms  possess  more  the  charm  of  decay. Another  point 
wherein the Vosges district excels is its ruins. Many of its nu-
merous castles are perched where you might think only eagles 
would care to build. In others, commenced by the Romans and 
finished by the Troubadours, covering acres with the maze of 
their still standing walls, one may wander for hours.

The fruiterer and greengrocer is a person unknown in the 
Vosges. Most things of that kind grow wild, and are to be had 
for the picking. It is difficult to keep to any programme when 
walking  through  the Vosges,  the  temptation  on  a  hot  day  to 
stop  and  eat  fruit  generally  being  too  strong  for  resistance. 
Raspberries, the most delicious I have ever tasted, wild straw-
berries,  currants,  and  gooseberries,  grow  upon  the  hill-sides 
as black-berries by English lanes. The Vosges small boy is not 
called upon to rob an orchard; he can make himself ill without 
sin. Orchards exist in the Vosges mountains in plenty; but to 
trespass into one for the purpose of stealing fruit would be as 
foolish as for a fish to try and get into a swimming bath with-
out paying. Still, of course, mistakes do occur.

One afternoon in the course of a climb we emerged upon a 
plateau, where we lingered perhaps too long, eating more fruit 
than  may  have  been  good  for  us;  it  was  so  plentiful  around 
us,  so  varied.  We  commenced  with  a  few  late  strawberries, 
and from those we passed to raspberries. Then Harris found a 
greengage-tree with some early fruit upon it, just perfect.

“This is about the best thing we have struck,” said George; 

— 360 —

“we had better make the most of this.” Which was good advice, 
on the face of it.

“It is a pity,” said Harris, “that the pears are still so hard.”
He grieved about this for a while, but later on came across 
some  remarkably  fine  yellow  plums  and  these  consoled  him 
somewhat.

“I  suppose  we  are  still  a  bit  too  far  north  for  pineapples,” 
said George. “I feel I could just enjoy a fresh pineapple. This 
commonplace fruit palls upon one after a while.”

“Too  much  bush  fruit  and  not  enough  tree,  is  the  fault  I 
find,”  said  Harris. “Myself,  I  should  have  liked  a  few  more 
greengages.”

“Here is a man coming up the hill,” I observed, “who looks 
like  a  native.  Maybe,  he  will  know  where  we  can  find  some 
more greengages.”

“He walks well for an old chap,” remarked Harris.
He certainly was climbing the hill at a remarkable pace. Also, 
so far as we were able to judge at that distance, he appeared to 
be in a remarkably cheerful mood, singing and shouting at the 
top of his voice, gesticulating, and waving his arms.

“What a merry old soul it is,” said Harris; “it does one good 
to watch him. But why does he carry his stick over his shoul-
der? Why doesn’t he use it to help him up the hill?”

“Do you know, I don’t think it is a stick,” said George.
“What can it be, then?” asked Harris.
“Well, it looks to me,” said George, “more like a gun.”
“You don’t think we can have made a mistake?” suggested 
Harris. “You don’t think this can be anything in the nature of 
a private orchard?”

I said: “Do you remember the sad thing that happened in 
the  South  of  France  some  two  years  ago?  A  soldier  picked 
some cherries as he passed a house, and the French peasant to 
whom the cherries belonged came out, and without a word of 
warning shot him dead.”

“But  surely  you  are  not  allowed  to  shoot  a  man  dead  for 

picking fruit, even in France?” said George.

— 361 —

“Of course not,” I answered. “It was quite illegal. The only 
excuse offered by his counsel was that he was of a highly ex-
citable disposition, and especially keen about these particular 
cherries.”

“I recollect something about the case,” said Harris, “now you 
mention  it.  I  believe  the  district  in  which  it  happened — the 
‘Commune,’ as I think it is called — had to pay heavy compen-
sation to the relatives of the deceased soldier; which was only 
fair.”

George  said: “I  am  tired  of  this  place.  Besides,  it’s  getting 

late.”

Harris said: “If he goes at that rate he will fall and hurt him-

self. Besides, I don’t believe he knows the way.”

I felt lonesome up there all by myself, with nobody to speak 
to. Besides, not since I was a boy, I reflected, had I enjoyed a 
run down a really steep hill. I thought I would see if I could 
revive the sensation. It is a jerky exercise, but good, I should 
say, for the liver.

We  slept  that  night  at  Barr,  a  pleasant  little  town  on  the 
way to St. Ottilienberg, an interesting old convent among the 
mountains, where you are waited upon by real nuns, and your 
bill made out by a priest. At Barr, just before supper a tourist 
entered. He looked English, but spoke a language the like of 
which I have never heard before. Yet it was an elegant and fine-
sounding  language.  The  landlord  stared  at  him  blankly;  the 
landlady shook her head. He sighed, and tried another, which 
somehow  recalled  to  me  forgotten  memories,  though,  at  the 
time, I could not fix it. But again nobody understood him.

“This is damnable,” he said aloud to himself.
“Ah, you are English!” exclaimed the landlord, brightening 

up.

“And Monsieur looks tired,” added the bright little landlady. 

“Monsieur will have supper.”

They both spoke English excellently, nearly as well as they 
spoke French and German; and they bustled about and made 

— 362 —

him comfortable. At supper he sat next to me, and I talked to 
him.

“Tell me,” I said — I was curious on the subject — “what lan-

guage was it you spoke when you first came in?”

“German,” he explained.
“Oh,” I replied, “I beg your pardon.”
“You did not understand it?” he continued.
“It must have been my fault,” I answered; “my knowledge is 
extremely limited. One picks up a little here and there as one 
goes about, but of course that is a different thing.”

“But they did not understand it,” he replied, “the landlord 

and his wife; and it is their own language.”

“I do not think so,” I said. “The children hereabout speak 
German, it is true, and our landlord and landlady know Ger-
man to a certain point. But throughout Alsace and Lorraine 
the old people still talk French.”

“And I spoke to them in French also,” he added, “and they 

understood that no better.”

“It is certainly very curious,” I agreed.
“It is more than curious,” he replied; “in my case it is in-
comprehensible. I possess a diploma for modern languages. I 
won my scholarship purely on the strength of my French and 
German.  The  correctness  of  my  construction,  the  purity  of 
my  pronunciation,  was  considered  at  my  college  to  be  quite 
remarkable. Yet, when I come abroad hardly anybody under-
stands a word I say. Can you explain it?”

“I think I can,” I replied. “Your pronunciation is too fault-
less. You remember what the Scotsman said when for the first 
time  in  his  life  he  tasted  real  whisky: ‘It  may  be  puir,  but  I 
canna drink it’; so it is with your German. It strikes one less 
as a language than as an exhibition. If I might offer advice, I 
should say: Mispronounce as much as possible, and throw in 
as many mistakes as you can think of.”

It is the same everywhere. Each country keeps a special pro-
nunciation exclusively for the use of foreigners — a pronuncia-
tion they never dream of using themselves, that they cannot 

— 363 —

understand when it is used. I once heard an English lady ex-
plaining to a Frenchman how to pronounce the word Have.

“You will pronounce it,” said the lady reproachfully, “as if it 

were spelt H-a-v. It isn’t. There is an ‘e’ at the end.”

“But I thought,” said the pupil, “that you did not sound the 

‘e’ at the end of h-a-v-e.”

“No more you do,” explained his teacher. “It is what we call a 
mute ‘e’; but it exercises a modifying influence on the preced-
ing vowel.”

Before that, he used to say “have” quite intelligently. After-
wards, when he came to the word he would stop dead, collect 
his thoughts, and give expression to a sound that only the con-
text could explain.

Putting aside the sufferings of the early martyrs, few men, I 
suppose, have gone through more than I myself went through 
in trying to I attain the correct pronunciation of the German 
word for church — “Kirche.” Long before I had done with it I 
had determined never to go to church in Germany, rather than 
be bothered with it.

“No, no,” my teacher would explain — he was a painstaking 
gentleman; “you say it as if it were spelt K-i-r-c-h-k-e. There 
is no k. It is — .” And he would illustrate to me again, for the 
twentieth  time  that  morning,  how  it  should  be  pronounced; 
the sad thing being that I could never for the life of me detect 
any difference between the way he said it and the way I said it. 
So he would try a new method.

“You  say  it  from  your  throat,”  he  would  explain.  He  was 
quite right; I did. “I want you to say it from down here,” and 
with a fat forefinger he would indicate the region from where 
I was to start. After painful efforts, resulting in sounds sugges-
tive of anything rather than a place of worship, I would excuse 
myself.

“I really fear it is impossible,” I would say. “You see, for years 
I have always talked with my mouth, as it were; I never knew 
a man could talk with his stomach. I doubt if it is not too late 
now for me to learn.”

— 364 —

By spending hours in dark corners, and practising in silent 
streets,  to  the  terror  of  chance  passers-by,  I  came  at  last  to 
pronounce this word correctly. My teacher was delighted with 
me, and until I came to Germany I was pleased with myself. 
In Germany I found that nobody understood what I meant by 
it. I never got near a church with it. I had to drop the correct 
pronunciation,  and  painstakingly  go  back  to  my  first  wrong 
pronunciation.  Then  they  would  brighten  up,  and  tell  me  it 
was  round  the  corner,  or  down  the  next  street,  as  the  case 
might be.

I also think pronunciation of a foreign tongue could be bet-
ter  taught  than  by  demanding  from  the  pupil  those  internal 
acrobatic feats that are generally impossible and always use-
less. This is the sort of instruction one receives:

“Press  your  tonsils  against  the  underside  of  your  larynx. 
Then with the convex part of the septum curved upwards so 
as  almost — but  not  quite — to  touch  the  uvula,  try  with  the 
tip of your tongue to reach your thyroid. Take a deep breath, 
and compress your glottis. Now, without opening your lips, say 
‘Garoo.’”

And when you have done it they are not satisfied.

The English boy plays till he is fifteen, and works thence till 
twenty. In Germany it is the child that works; the young man 
that plays. The German boy goes to school at seven o’clock in 
the summer, at eight in the winter, and at school he studies. 
The result is that at sixteen he has a thorough knowledge of 
the classics and mathematics, knows as much history as any 
man compelled to belong to a political party is wise in know-
ing, together with a thorough grounding in modern languages. 
Therefore  his  eight  College  Semesters,  extending  over  four 
years, are, except for the young man aiming at a professorship, 
unnecessarily  ample.  He  is  not  a  sportsman,  which  is  a  pity, 
for he should make good one. He plays football a little, bicy-
cles still less; plays French billiards in stuffy cafés more. But 
generally speaking he, or the majority of him, lays out his time 
bummeling, beer drinking, and fighting. If he be the son of a 
wealthy father he joins a Korps — to belong to a crack Korps 
costs about four hundred pounds a year. If he be a middle-class 
young man, he enrols himself in a Burschenschaft, or a Lands-
mannschaft,  which  is  a  little  cheaper.  These  companies  are 
again broken up into smaller circles, in which attempt is made 
to keep to nationality. There are the Swabians, from Swabia; 
the Frankonians, descendants of the Franks; the Thuringians, 
and so forth. In practice, of course, this results as all such at-
tempts do result — I believe half our Gordon Highlanders are 

— 366 —

Cockneys — but the picturesque object is obtained of dividing 
each University into some dozen or so separate companies of 
students,  each  one  with  its  distinctive  cap  and  colours,  and, 
quite as important, its own particular beer hall, into which no 
other student wearing his colours may come.

The chief work of these student companies is to fight among 
themselves, or with some rival Korps or Schaft, the celebrated 
German Mensur.

The Mensur has been described so often and so thoroughly 
that I do not intend to bore my readers with any detailed ac-
count of it. I merely come forward as an impressionist, and I 
write purposely the impression of my first Mensur, because I 
believe  that  first  impressions  are  more  true  and  useful  than 
opinions blunted by intercourse, or shaped by influence.

A Frenchman or a Spaniard will seek to persuade you that 
the bull-ring is an institution got up chiefly for the benefit of 
the bull. The horse which you imagined to be screaming with 
pain was only laughing at the comical appearance presented 
by its own inside. Your French or Spanish friend contrasts its 
glorious and exciting death in the ring with the cold-blooded 
brutality of the knacker’s yard. If you do not keep a tight hold 
of your head, you come away with the desire to start an agita-
tion for the inception of the bull-ring in England as an aid to 
chivalry. No doubt Torquemada was convinced of the human-
ity of the Inquisition. To a stout gentleman, suffering, perhaps, 
from  cramp  or  rheumatism,  an  hour  or  so  on  the  rack  was 
really  a  physical  benefit.  He  would  rise  feeling  more  free  in 
his joints — more elastic, as one might say, than he had felt for 
years. English huntsmen regard the fox as an animal to be en-
vied. A day’s excellent sport is provided for him free of charge, 
during which he is the centre of attraction.

Use blinds one to everything one does not wish to see. Every 
third German gentleman you meet in the street still bears, and 
will bear to his grave, marks of the twenty to a hundred duels 
he has fought in his student days. The German children play 
at  the  Mensur  in  the  nursery,  rehearse  it  in  the  gymnasium. 

— 367 —

The Germans have come to persuade themselves there is no 
brutality  in  it — nothing  offensive,  nothing  degrading.  Their 
argument is that it schools the German youth to coolness and 
courage. If this could be proved, the argument, particularly in 
a country where every man is a soldier, would be sufficiently 
one-sided. But is the virtue of the prize-fighter the virtue of 
the soldier? One doubts it. Nerve and dash are surely of more 
service in the field than a temperament of unreasoning indif-
ference as to what is happening to one. As a matter of fact, the 
German  student  would  have  to  be  possessed  of  much  more 
courage  not  to  fight.  He  fights  not  to  please  himself,  but  to 
satisfy a public opinion that is two hundred years behind the 
times.

All the Mensur does is to brutalise him. There may be skill 
displayed — I  am  told  there  is, — but  it  is  not  apparent.  The 
mere fighting is like nothing so much as a broadsword combat 
at a Richardson’s show; the display as a whole a successful at-
tempt to combine the ludicrous with the unpleasant. In aris-
tocratic  Bonn,  where  style  is  considered,  and  in  Heidelberg, 
where visitors from other nations are more common, the affair 
is perhaps more formal. I am told that there the contests take 
place in handsome rooms; that grey-haired doctors wait upon 
the wounded, and liveried servants upon the hungry, and that 
the affair is conducted throughout with a certain amount of 
picturesque  ceremony.  In  the  more  essentially  German  Uni-
versities, where strangers are rare and not much encouraged, 
the simple essentials are the only things kept in view, and these 
are not of an inviting nature.

Indeed, so distinctly uninviting are they, that I strongly ad-
vise the sensitive reader to avoid even this description of them. 
The subject cannot be made pretty, and I do not intend to try.
The room is bare and sordid; its walls splashed with mixed 
stains of beer, blood, and candle-grease; its ceiling, smoky; its 
floor, sawdust covered. A crowd of students, laughing, smok-
ing,  talking,  some  sitting  on  the  floor,  others  perched  upon 
chairs and benches form the framework.

— 368 —

In  the  centre,  facing  one  another,  stand  the  combatants, 
resembling  Japanese  warriors,  as  made  familiar  to  us  by  the 
Japanese tea-tray. Quaint and rigid, with their goggle-covered 
eyes, their necks tied up in comforters, their bodies smothered 
in what looks like dirty bed quilts, their padded arms stretched 
straight  above  their  heads,  they  might  be  a  pair  of  ungainly 
clockwork  figures.  The  seconds,  also  more  or  less  pad-
ded — their heads and faces protected by huge leather-peaked 
caps, — drag them out into their proper position. One almost 
listens to hear the sound of the castors. The umpire takes his 
place,  the  word  is  given,  and  immediately  there  follow  five 
rapid clashes of the long straight swords. There is no interest 
in watching the fight: there is no movement, no skill, no grace 
(I  am  speaking  of  my  own  impressions.)  The  strongest  man 
wins;  the  man  who,  with  his  heavily-padded  arm,  always  in 
an unnatural position, can hold his huge clumsy sword long-
est without growing too weak to be able either to guard or to 
strike.

The whole interest is centred in watching the wounds. They 
come always in one of two places — on the top of the head or 
the left side of the face. Sometimes a portion of hairy scalp or 
section of cheek flies up into the air, to be carefully preserved 
in  an  envelope  by  its  proud  possessor,  or,  strictly  speaking, 
its  proud  former  possessor,  and  shown  round  on  convivial 
evenings; and from every wound, of course, flows a plentiful 
stream of blood. It splashes doctors, seconds, and spectators; it 
sprinkles ceiling and walls; it saturates the fighters, and makes 
pools for itself in the sawdust. At the end of each round the 
doctors rush up, and with hands already dripping with blood 
press  together  the  gaping  wounds,  dabbing  them  with  little 
balls of wet cotton wool, which an attendant carries ready on a 
plate. Naturally, the moment the men stand up again and com-
mence work, the blood gushes out again, half blinding them, 
and  rendering  the  ground  beneath  them  slippery.  Now  and 
then you see a man’s teeth laid bare almost to the ear, so that 
for the rest of the duel he appears to be grinning at one half 

— 369 —

of the spectators, his other side, remaining serious; and some-
times a man’s nose gets slit, which gives to him as he fights a 
singularly supercilious air.

As the object of each student is to go away from the Univer-
sity bearing as many scars as possible, I doubt if any particular 
pains are taken to guard, even to the small extent such method 
of fighting can allow. The real victor is he who comes out with 
the  greatest  number  of  wounds;  he  who  then,  stitched  and 
patched almost to unrecognition as a human being, can prom-
enade for the next month, the envy of the German youth, the 
admiration of the German maiden. He who obtains only a few 
unimportant wounds retires sulky and disappointed.

But the actual fighting is only the beginning of the fun. The 
second act of the spectacle takes place in the dressing-room. 
The doctors are generally mere medical students — young fel-
lows who, having taken their degree, are anxious for practice. 
Truth  compels  me  to  say  that  those  with  whom  I  came  in 
contact  were  coarse-looking  men  who  seemed  rather  to  rel-
ish  their  work.  Perhaps  they  are  not  to  be  blamed  for  this. 
It  is  part  of  the  system  that  as  much  further  punishment  as 
possible must be inflicted by the doctor, and the ideal medical 
man  might  hardly  care  for  such  job.  How  the  student  bears 
the dressing of his wounds is as important as how he receives 
them. Every operation has to be performed as brutally as may 
be, and his companions carefully watch him during the process 
to see that he goes through it with an appearance of peace and 
enjoyment. A clean-cut wound that gapes wide is most desired 
by all parties. On purpose it is sewn up clumsily, with the hope 
that by this means the scar will last a lifetime. Such a wound, 
judiciously mauled and interfered with during the week after-
wards,  can  generally  be  reckoned  on  to  secure  its  fortunate 
possessor a wife with a dowry of five figures at the least.

These are the general bi-weekly Mensurs, of which the av-
erage  student  fights  some  dozen  a  year.  There  are  others  to 
which visitors are not admitted. When a student is considered 
to  have  disgraced  himself  by  some  slight  involuntary  move-

— 370 —

ment  of  the  head  or  body  while  fighting,  then  he  can  only 
regain his position by standing up to the best swordsman in 
his Korps. He demands and is accorded, not a contest, but a 
punishment.  His  opponent  then  proceeds  to  inflict  as  many 
and as bloody wounds as can be taken. The object of the victim 
is to show his comrades that he can stand still while his head is 
half sliced from his skull.

Whether  anything  can  properly  be  said  in  favour  of  the 
German  Mensur  I  am  doubtful;  but  if  so  it  concerns  only 
the  two  combatants.  Upon  the  spectators  it  can  and  does,  I 
am  convinced,  exercise  nothing  but  evil.  I  know  myself  suf-
ficiently well to be sure I am not of an unusually bloodthirsty 
disposition. The effect it had upon me can only be the usual 
effect. At first, before the actual work commenced, my sensa-
tion  was  curiosity  mingled  with  anxiety  as  to  how  the  sight 
would trouble me, though some slight acquaintance with dis-
secting-rooms and operating tables left me less doubt on that 
point than I might otherwise have felt. As the blood began to 
flow, and nerves and muscles to be laid bare, I experienced a 
mingling of disgust and pity. But with the second duel, I must 
confess, my finer feelings began to disappear; and by the time 
the third was well upon its way, and the room heavy with the 
curious hot odour of blood, I began, as the American expres-
sion is, to see things red.

I wanted more. I looked from face to face surrounding me, 
and in most of them I found reflected undoubtedly my own 
sensations. If it be a good thing to excite this blood thirst in 
the modern man, then the Mensur is a useful institution. But 
is it a good thing? We prate about our civilisation and human-
ity, but those of us who do not carry hypocrisy to the length of 
self-deception know that underneath our starched shirts there 
lurks the savage, with all his savage instincts untouched. Oc-
casionally he may be wanted, but we never need fear his dying 
out. On the other hand, it seems unwise to over-nourish him.
In favour of the duel, seriously considered, there are many 
points to be urged. But the Mensur serves no good purpose 

— 371 —

whatever.  It  is  childishness,  and  the  fact  of  its  being  a  cruel 
and brutal game makes it none the less childish. Wounds have 
no intrinsic value of their own; it is the cause that dignifies 
them, not their size. William Tell is rightly one of the heroes of 
the world; but what should we think of the members of a club 
of fathers, formed with the object of meeting twice a week to 
shoot  apples  from  their  sons’  heads  with  cross-bows?  These 
young German gentlemen could obtain all the results of which 
they are so proud by teasing a wild cat! To join a society for the 
mere purpose of getting yourself hacked about reduces a man 
to the intellectual level of a dancing Dervish. Travellers tell us 
of savages in Central Africa who express their feelings on fes-
tive occasions by jumping about and slashing themselves. But 
there is no need for Europe to imitate them. The Mensur is, in 
fact, the reductio ad absurdum of the duel; and if the Germans 
themselves cannot see that it is funny, one can only regret their 
lack of humour.

But  though  one  may  be  unable  to  agree  with  the  public 
opinion that supports and commands the Mensur, it at least 
is possible to understand. The University code that, if it does 
not encourage it, at least condones drunkenness, is more dif-
ficult to treat argumentatively. All German students do not get 
drunk; in fact, the majority are sober, if not industrious. But 
the minority, whose claim to be representative is freely admit-
ted, are only saved from perpetual inebriety by ability, acquired 
at some cost, to swill half the day and all the night, while re-
taining to some extent their five senses. It does not affect all 
alike, but it is common in any University town to see a young 
man not yet twenty with the figure of a Falstaff and the com-
plexion of a Rubens Bacchus. That the German maiden can be 
fascinated  with  a  face,  cut  and  gashed  till  it  suggests  having 
been made out of odd materials that never could have fitted, 
is a proved fact. But surely there can be no attraction about a 
blotched and bloated skin and a “bay window” thrown out to 
an extent threatening to overbalance the whole structure. Yet 
what else can be expected, when the youngster starts his beer-

— 372 —

drinking with a “Fruhschoppen” at 10 a.m., and closes it with 
a “Kneipe” at four in the morning?

The Kneipe is what we should call a stag party, and can be 
very  harmless  or  very  rowdy,  according  to  its  composition. 
One man invites his fellow-students, a dozen or a hundred, to a 
café, and provides them with as much beer and as many cheap 
cigars as their own sense of health and comfort may dictate, 
or the host may be the Korps itself. Here, as everywhere, you 
observe the German sense of discipline and order. As each new 
comer  enters  all  those  sitting  round  the  table  rise,  and  with 
heels close together salute. When the table is complete, a chair-
man is chosen, whose duty it is to give out the number of the 
songs. Printed books of these songs, one to each two men, lie 
round the table. The chairman gives out number twenty-nine. 
“First verse,” he cries, and away all go, each two men holding a 
book between them exactly as two people might hold a hymn-
book in church. There is a pause at the end of each verse until 
the chairman starts the company on the next. As every Ger-
man is a trained singer, and as most of them have fair voices, 
the general effect is striking.

Although the manner may be suggestive of the singing of 
hymns in church, the words of the songs are occasionally such 
as to correct this impression. But whether it be a patriotic song, 
a sentimental ballad, or a ditty of a nature that would shock 
the average young Englishman, all are sung through with stern 
earnestness, without a laugh, without a false note. At the end, 
the  chairman  calls “Prosit!”  Everyone  answers “Prosit!”  and 
the next moment every glass is empty. The pianist rises and 
bows, and is bowed to in return; and then the Fraulein enters 
to refill the glasses.

Between the songs, toasts are proposed and responded to; 
but there is little cheering, and less laughter. Smiles and grave 
nods of approval are considered as more seeming among Ger-
man students.

A  particular  toast,  called  a  Salamander,  accorded  to  some 

— 373 —

guest  as  a  special  distinction,  is  drunk  with  exceptional  so-
lemnity.

“We will now,” says the chairman, “a Salamander rub” (“Ein-
en Salamander reiben”). We all rise, and stand like a regiment 
at attention.

“Is the stuff prepared?” (“Sind die stoffe parat?”) demands 

the chairman.

“Sunt,” we answer, with one voice.
“Ad exercitium Salamandri,” says the chairman, and we are 

“Eins!” We  rub  our  glasses  with  a  circular  motion  on  the 

ready.

table.

“Zwei!” Again the glasses growl; also at “Drei!”
“Drink!” (“Bibite!”)
And  with  mechanical  unison  every  glass  is  emptied  and 

held on high.

“Eins!”  says  the  chairman.  The  foot  of  every  empty  glass 
twirls  upon  the  table,  producing  a  sound  as  of  the  dragging 
back of a stony beach by a receding wave.
“Zwei!” The roll swells and sinks again.
“Drei!” The glasses strike the table with a single crash, and 

we are in our seats again.

The  sport  at  the  Kneipe  is  for  two  students  to  insult  each 
other (in play, of course), and to then challenge each other to 
a drinking duel. An umpire is appointed, two huge glasses are 
filled,  and  the  men  sit  opposite  each  other  with  their  hands 
upon the handles, all eyes fixed upon them. The umpire gives 
the  word  to  go,  and  in  an  instant  the  beer  is  gurgling  down 
their throats. The man who bangs his perfectly finished glass 
upon the table first is victor.

Strangers who are going through a Kneipe, and who wish to 
do the thing in German style, will do well, before commencing 
proceedings, to pin their name and address upon their coats. 
The German student is courtesy itself, and whatever his own 
state may be, he will see to it that, by some means or another, 

— 374 —

his guest gets safely home before the morning. But, of course, 
he cannot be expected to remember addresses.

A story was told me of three guests to a Berlin Kneipe which 
might  have  had  tragic  results.  The  strangers  determined  to 
do the thing thoroughly. They explained their intention, and 
were applauded, and each proceeded to write his address upon 
his card, and pin it to the tablecloth in front of him. That was 
the mistake they made. They should, as I have advised, have 
pinned it carefully to their coats. A man may change his place 
at a table, quite unconsciously he may come out the other side 
of it; but wherever he goes he takes his coat with him.

Some time in the small hours, the chairman suggested that 
to make things more comfortable for those still upright, all the 
gentlemen unable to keep their heads off the table should be 
sent  home. Among  those  to  whom  the  proceedings  had  be-
come uninteresting were the three Englishmen. It was decided 
to put them into a cab in charge of a comparatively speaking 
sober student, and return them. Had they retained their origi-
nal  seats  throughout  the  evening  all  would  have  been  well; 
but,  unfortunately,  they  had  gone  walking  about,  and  which 
gentleman belonged to which card nobody knew — least of all 
the guests themselves. In the then state of general cheerfulness, 
this  did  not  to  anybody  appear  to  much  matter.  There  were 
three gentlemen and three addresses. I suppose the idea was 
that even if a mistake were made, the parties could be sorted 
out  in  the  morning.  Anyhow,  the  three  gentlemen  were  put 
into a cab, the comparatively speaking sober student took the 
three cards in his hand, and the party started amid the cheers 
and good wishes of the company.

There  is  this  advantage  about  German  beer:  it  does  not 
make a man drunk as the word drunk is understood in Eng-
land. There is nothing objectionable about him; he is simply 
tired. He does not want to talk; he wants to be let alone, to go 
to sleep; it does not matter where — anywhere.

The conductor of the party stopped his cab at the nearest 
address. He took out his worst case; it was a natural instinct 

— 375 —

to get rid of that first. He and the cabman carried it upstairs, 
and rang the bell of the Pension. A sleepy porter answered it. 
They carried their burden in, and looked for a place to drop it. 
A bedroom door happened to be open; the room was empty; 
could anything be better? — they took it in there. They relieved 
it of such things as came off easily, and laid it in the bed. This 
done, both men, pleased with themselves, returned to the cab.
At the next address they stopped again. This time, in answer 
to their summons, a lady appeared, dressed in a tea gown, with 
a book in her hand. The German student looked at the top one 
of two cards remaining in his hand, and enquired if he had the 
pleasure of addressing Frau Y. It happened that he had, though 
so far as any pleasure was concerned that appeared to be en-
tirely on his side. He explained to Frau Y. that the gentleman 
at that moment asleep against the wall was her husband. The 
reunion moved her to no enthusiasm; she simply opened the 
bedroom  door,  and  then  walked  away.  The  cabman  and  the 
student took him in, and laid him on the bed. They did not 
trouble to undress him, they were feeling tired! They did not 
see the lady of the house again, and retired therefore without 
adieus.

The  last  card  was  that  of  a  bachelor  stopping  at  an  hotel. 
They took their last man, therefore, to that hotel, passed him 
over to the night porter, and left him.

To  return  to  the  address  at  which  the  first  delivery  was 
made,  what  had  happened  there  was  this.  Some  eight  hours 
previously had said Mr. X. to Mrs. X.: “I think I told you, my 
dear, that I had an invitation for this evening to what, I believe, 
is called a Kneipe?”

“You  did  mention  something  of  the  sort,”  replied  Mrs.  X. 

“What is a Kneipe?”

“Well, it’s a sort of bachelor party, my dear, where the stu-
dents meet to sing and talk and — and smoke, and all that sort 
of thing, you know.”

“Oh, well, I hope you will enjoy yourself!” said Mrs. X., who 

was a nice woman and sensible.

— 376 —

“It will be interesting,” observed Mr. X. “I have often had a 
curiosity to see one. I may,” continued Mr. X., — “I mean it is 
possible, that I may be home a little late.”
“What do you call late?” asked Mrs. X.
“It is somewhat difficult to say,” returned Mr. X. “You see 
these students, they are a wild lot, and when they get togeth-
er — And then, I believe, a good many toasts are drunk. I don’t 
know how it will affect me. If I can see an opportunity I shall 
come away early, that is if I can do so without giving offence; 
but if not —”

Said Mrs. X., who, as I remarked before, was a sensible wom-
an: “You had better get the people here to lend you a latchkey. I 
shall sleep with Dolly, and then you won’t disturb me whatever 
time it may be.”

“I  think  that  an  excellent  idea  of  yours,”  agreed  Mr.  X. “I 
should  hate  disturbing  you.  I  shall  just  come  in  quietly,  and 
slip into bed.”

Some time in the middle of the night, or maybe towards the 
early  morning,  Dolly,  who  was  Mrs.  X.’s  sister,  sat  up  in  bed 
and listened.

“Jenny,” said Dolly, “are you awake?”
“Yes, dear,” answered Mrs. X. “It’s all right. You go to sleep 

again.”

“But whatever is it?” asked Dolly. “Do you think it’s fire?”
“I expect,” replied Mrs. X., “that it’s Percy. Very possibly he 
has  stumbled  over  something  in  the  dark.  Don’t  you  worry, 
dear; you go to sleep.”

But so soon as Dolly had dozed off again, Mrs. X., who was 
a  good  wife,  thought  she  would  steal  off  softly  and  see  to  it 
that Percy was all right. So, putting on a dressing-gown and 
slippers, she crept along the passage and into her own room. 
To awake the gentleman on the bed would have required an 
earthquake. She lit a candle and stole over to the bedside.

It was not Percy; it was not anyone like Percy. She felt it was 
not the man that ever could have been her husband, under any 
circumstances. In his present condition her sentiment towards 

— 377 —

him was that of positive dislike. Her only desire was to get rid 
of him.

But something there was about him which seemed familiar 
to her. She went nearer, and took a closer view. Then she re-
membered. Surely it was Mr. Y., a gentleman at whose flat she 
and Percy had dined the day they first arrived in Berlin.

But what was he doing here? She put the candle on the table, 
and taking her head between her hands sat down to think. The 
explanation of the thing came to her with a rush. It was with 
this Mr. Y. that Percy had gone to the Kneipe. A mistake had 
been made. Mr. Y. had been brought back to Percy’s address. 
Percy at this very moment —

The terrible possibilities of the situation swam before her. 
Returning  to  Dolly’s  room,  she  dressed  herself  hastily,  and 
silently crept downstairs. Finding, fortunately, a passing night-
cab,  she  drove  to  the  address  of  Mrs. Y.  Telling  the  man  to 
wait, she flew upstairs and rang persistently at the bell. It was 
opened as before by Mrs. Y., still in her tea-gown, and with her 
book still in her hand.

“Mrs. X.!” exclaimed Mrs. Y. “Whatever brings you here?”
“My husband!” was all poor Mrs. X. could think to say at the 

moment, “is he here?”

height, “how dare you?”

“Mrs. X.,” returned Mrs. Y., drawing herself up to her full 

“Oh, please don’t misunderstand me!” pleaded Mrs. X. “It’s 
all a terrible mistake. They must have brought poor Percy here 
instead of to our place, I’m sure they must. Do please look and 
see.”

“My  dear,”  said  Mrs.  Y.,  who  was  a  much  older  woman, 
and more motherly, “don’t excite yourself. They brought him 
here about half an hour ago, and, to tell you the truth, I never 
looked at him. He is in here. I don’t think they troubled to take 
off  even  his  boots.  If  you  keep  cool,  we  will  get  him  down-
stairs  and  home  without  a  soul  beyond  ourselves  being  any 
the wiser.”

Indeed, Mrs. Y. seemed quite eager to help Mrs. X.

— 378 —

She pushed open the door, and Mrs. X, went in. The next 

moment she came out with a white, scared face.

“It isn’t Percy,” she said. “Whatever am I to do?”
“I  wish  you  wouldn’t  make  these  mistakes,”  said  Mrs.  Y., 

moving to enter the room herself.

Mrs. X. stopped her. “And it isn’t your husband either.”
“Nonsense,” said Mrs. Y.
“It isn’t really,” persisted Mrs. X. “I know, because I have just 

left him, asleep on Percy’s bed.”

“What’s he doing there?” thundered Mrs. Y.
“They  brought  him  there,  and  put  him  there,”  explained 
Mrs. X., beginning to cry. “That’s what made me think Percy 
must be here.”

The two women stood and looked at one another; and there 
was silence for awhile, broken only by the snoring of the gen-
tleman the other side of the half-open door.

“Then who is that, in there?” demanded Mrs. Y., who was 

the first to recover herself.

“I  don’t  know,”  answered  Mrs.  X., “I  have  never  seen  him 

before. Do you think it is anybody you know?”

But Mrs. Y. only banged to the door.
“What are we to do?” said Mrs. X.
“I know what I am going to do,” said Mrs. Y. “I’m coming 

back with you to fetch my husband.”

“He’s very sleepy,” explained Mrs. X.
“I’ve known him to be that before,” replied Mrs. Y., as she 

fastened on her cloak.

scended the stairs together.

“But where’s Percy?” sobbed poor little Mrs. X., as they de-

“That my dear,” said Mrs. Y., “will be a question for you to 

ask him.”

“If they go about making mistakes like this,” said Mrs. X., “it 

is impossible to say what they may not have done with him.”

“We will make enquiries in the morning, my dear,” said Mrs. 

Y., consolingly.

“I think these Kneipes are disgraceful affairs,” said Mrs. X. “I 

shall never let Percy go to another, never — so long as I live.”

“My dear,” remarked Mrs. Y., “if you know your duty, he will 

never want to.” And rumour has it that he never did.

But, as I have said, the mistake was in pinning the card to 
the tablecloth instead of to the coat. And error in this world is 
always severely punished.

CHAPTER XIV

Which  is  serious:  as  becomes  a  parting  chapter — The  German 
from the Anglo-Saxon’s point of view — Providence in buttons and 
a helmet — Paradise of the helpless idiot — German conscience: its 
aggressiveness — How they hang in Germany, very possibly — What 
happens to good Germans when they die? — The military instinct: 
is it all-sufficient? — The German as a shopkeeper — How he sup-
ports life — The New Woman, here as everywhere — What can be 
said against the Germans, as a people — The Bummel is over and 

done.

“ANYBODY  could  rule  this  country,”  said  George; “I  could 
rule it.”

We  were  seated  in  the  garden  of  the  Kaiser  Hof  at  Bonn, 
looking down upon the Rhine. It was the last evening of our 
Bummel; the early morning train would be the beginning of 
the end.

“I  should  write  down  all  I  wanted  the  people  to  do  on  a 
piece of paper,” continued George; “get a good firm to print 
off so many copies, have them posted about the towns and vil-
lages; and the thing would be done.”

In the placid, docile German of to-day, whose only ambition 
appears to be to pay his taxes, and do what he is told to do by 
those  whom  it  has  pleased  Providence  to  place  in  authority 
over him, it is difficult, one must confess, to detect any trace of 
his wild ancestor, to whom individual liberty was as the breath 
of  his  nostrils;  who  appointed  his  magistrates  to  advise,  but 
retained the right of execution for the tribe; who followed his 
chief, but would have scorned to obey him. In Germany to-day 
one hears a good deal concerning Socialism, but it is a Social-
ism that would only be despotism under another name. Indi-
vidualism makes no appeal to the German voter. He is willing, 
nay, anxious, to be controlled and regulated in all things. He 
disputes, not government, but the form of it. The policeman 
is to him a religion, and, one feels, will always remain so. In 
England we regard our man in blue as a harmless necessity. By 
the average citizen he is employed chiefly as a signpost, though 

— 381 —

in busy quarters of the town he is considered useful for taking 
old ladies across the road. Beyond feeling thankful to him for 
these services, I doubt if we take much thought of him. In Ger-
many, on the other hand, he is worshipped as a little god and 
loved as a guardian angel. To the German child he is a com-
bination of Santa Clans and the Bogie Man. All good things 
come from him: Spielplätze to play in, furnished with swings 
and giant-strides, sand heaps to fight around, swimming baths, 
and fairs. All misbehaviour is punished by him. It is the hope 
of every well-meaning German boy and girl to please the po-
lice. To be smiled at by a policeman makes it conceited. A Ger-
man child that has been patted on the head by a policeman is 
not fit to live with; its self-importance is unbearable.

The  German  citizen  is  a  soldier,  and  the  policeman  is  his 
officer. The policeman directs him where in the street to walk, 
and how fast to walk. At the end of each bridge stands a police-
man to tell the German how to cross it. Were there no police-
man there, he would probably sit down and wait till the river 
had passed by. At the railway station the policeman locks him 
up in the waiting-room, where he can do no harm to himself. 
When the proper time arrives, he fetches him out and hands 
him over to the guard of the train, who is only a policeman in 
another uniform. The guard tells him where to sit in the train, 
and when to get out, and sees that he does get out. In Germany 
you take no responsibility upon yourself whatever. Everything 
is done for you, and done well. You are not supposed to look af-
ter yourself; you are not blamed for being incapable of looking 
after yourself; it is the duty of the German policeman to look 
after you. That you may be a helpless idiot does not excuse him 
should anything happen to you. Wherever you are and what-
ever you are doing you are in his charge, and he takes care of 
you — good care of you; there is no denying this.

If you lose yourself, he finds you; and if you lose anything 
belonging to you, he recovers it for you. If you don’t know what 
you want, he tells you. If you want anything that is good for 
you to have, he gets it for you. Private lawyers are not needed 

— 382 —

in Germany. If you want to buy or sell a house or field, the State 
makes out the conveyance. If you have been swindled, the State 
takes up the case for you. The State marries you, insures you, 
will even gamble with you for a trifle.

“You  get  yourself  born,”  says  the  German  Government  to 
the German citizen, “we do the rest. Indoors and out of doors, 
in sickness and in health, in pleasure and in work, we will tell 
you what to do, and we will see to it that you do it. Don’t you 
worry yourself about anything.”

And the German doesn’t. Where there is no policeman to be 
found, he wanders about till he comes to a police notice posted 
on a wall. This he reads; then he goes and does what it says.

I remember in one German town — I forget which; it is im-
material; the incident could have happened in any — noticing 
an open gate leading to a garden in which a concert was being 
given. There was nothing to prevent anyone who chose from 
walking through that gate, and thus gaining admittance to the 
concert without paying. In fact, of the two gates quarter of a 
mile apart it was the more convenient. Yet of the crowds that 
passed, not one attempted to enter by that gate. They plodded 
steadily on under a blazing sun to the other gate, at which a 
man stood to collect the entrance money. I have seen German 
youngsters stand longingly by the margin of a lonely sheet of 
ice. They could have skated on that ice for hours, and nobody 
have  been  the  wiser.  The  crowd  and  the  police  were  at  the 
other end, more than half a mile away, and round the corner. 
Nothing stopped their going on but the knowledge that they 
ought not. Things such as these make one pause to seriously 
wonder whether the Teuton be a member of the sinful human 
family or not. Is it not possible that these placid, gentle folk 
may in reality be angels, come down to earth for the sake of a 
glass of beer, which, as they must know, can only in Germany 
be obtained worth the drinking?

In  Germany  the  country  roads  are  lined  with  fruit  trees. 
There is no voice to stay man or boy from picking and eating 
the fruit, except conscience. In England such a state of things 

— 383 —

would cause public indignation. Children would die of cholera 
by the hundred. The medical profession would be worked off 
its legs trying to cope with the natural results of over-indul-
gence in sour apples and unripe walnuts. Public opinion would 
demand that these fruit trees should be fenced about, and thus 
rendered harmless. Fruit growers, to save themselves the ex-
pense of walls and palings, would not be allowed in this man-
ner to spread sickness and death throughout the community.

But  in  Germany  a  boy  will  walk  for  miles  down  a  lonely 
road,  hedged  with  fruit  trees,  to  buy  a  pennyworth  of  pears 
in the village at the other end. To pass these unprotected fruit 
trees, drooping under their burden of ripe fruit, strikes the An-
glo-Saxon mind as a wicked waste of opportunity, a flouting of 
the blessed gifts of Providence.

I do not know if it be so, but from what I have observed of 
the German character I should not be surprised to hear that 
when a man in Germany is condemned to death he is given a 
piece of rope, and told to go and hang himself. It would save 
the State much trouble and expense, and I can see that German 
criminal taking that piece of rope home with him, reading up 
carefully the police instructions, and proceeding to carry them 
out in his own back kitchen.

The Germans are a good people. On the whole, the best peo-
ple perhaps in the world; an amiable, unselfish, kindly people. 
I  am  positive  that  the  vast  majority  of  them  go  to  Heaven. 
Indeed, comparing them with the other Christian nations of 
the  earth,  one  is  forced  to  the  conclusion  that  Heaven  will 
be chiefly of German manufacture. But I cannot understand 
how they get there. That the soul of any single individual Ger-
man  has  sufficient  initiative  to  fly  up  by  itself  and  knock  at 
St. Peter’s door, I cannot believe. My own opinion is that they 
are taken there in small companies, and passed in under the 
charge of a dead policeman.

Carlyle said of the Prussians, and it is true of the whole Ger-
man nation, that one of their chief virtues was their power of 
being drilled. Of the Germans you might say they are a people 

— 384 —

who  will  go  anywhere,  and  do  anything,  they  are  told.  Drill 
him for the work and send him out to Africa or Asia under 
charge of somebody in uniform, and he is bound to make an 
excellent colonist, facing difficulties as he would face the devil 
himself, if ordered. But it is not easy to conceive of him as a 
pioneer. Left to run himself, one feels he would soon fade away 
and die, not from any lack of intelligence, but from sheer want 
of presumption.

The  German  has  so  long  been  the  soldier  of  Europe,  that 
the military instinct has entered into his blood. The military 
virtues he possesses in abundance; but he also suffers from the 
drawbacks of the military training. It was told me of a Ger-
man servant, lately released from the barracks, that he was in-
structed by his master to deliver a letter to a certain house, and 
to wait there for the answer. The hours passed by, and the man 
did not return. His master, anxious and surprised, followed. He 
found the man where he had been sent, the answer in his hand. 
He was waiting for further orders. The story sounds exagger-
ated, but personally I can credit it.

The  curious  thing  is  that  the  same  man,  who  as  an  indi-
vidual is as helpless as a child, becomes, the moment he puts 
on the uniform, an intelligent being, capable of responsibility 
and initiative. The German can rule others, and be ruled by 
others,  but  he  cannot  rule  himself.  The  cure  would  appear 
to be to train every German for an officer, and then put him 
under himself. It is certain he would order himself about with 
discretion and judgment, and see to it that he himself obeyed 
himself with smartness and precision.

For the direction of German character into these channels, 
the schools, of course, are chiefly responsible. Their everlast-
ing teaching is duty. It is a fine ideal for any people; but before 
buckling to it, one would wish to have a clear understanding as 
to what this “duty” is. The German idea of it would appear to 
be: “blind obedience to everything in buttons.” It is the antith-
esis of the Anglo-Saxon scheme; but as both the Anglo-Saxon 
and  the  Teuton  are  prospering,  there  must  be  good  in  both 

— 385 —

methods. Hitherto, the German has had the blessed fortune to 
be exceptionally well governed; if this continue, it will go well 
with him. When his troubles will begin will be when by any 
chance  something  goes  wrong  with  the  governing  machine. 
But maybe his method has the advantage of producing a con-
tinuous supply of good governors; it would certainly seem so.
As a trader, I am inclined to think the German will, unless 
his  temperament  considerably  change,  remain  always  a  long 
way behind his Anglo-Saxon competitor; and this by reason 
of his virtues. To him life is something more important than 
a  mere  race  for  wealth. A  country  that  closes  its  banks  and 
post-offices  for  two  hours  in  the  middle  of  the  day,  while  it 
goes home and enjoys a comfortable meal in the bosom of its 
family,  with,  perhaps,  forty  winks  by  way  of  dessert,  cannot 
hope, and possibly has no wish, to compete with a people that 
takes its meals standing, and sleeps with a telephone over its 
bed. In Germany there is not, at all events as yet, sufficient dis-
tinction between the classes to make the struggle for position 
the life and death affair it is in England. Beyond the landed 
aristocracy, whose boundaries are impregnable, grade hardly 
counts.  Frau  Professor  and  Frau  Candlestickmaker  meet  at 
the weekly Kaffee-Klatsch and exchange scandal on terms of 
mutual equality. The livery-stable keeper and the doctor hob-
nob together at their favourite beer hall. The wealthy master 
builder, when he prepares his roomy waggon for an excursion 
into the country, invites his foreman and his tailor to join him 
with their families. Each brings his share of drink and provi-
sions, and returning home they sing in chorus the same songs. 
So long as this state of things endures, a man is not induced to 
sacrifice the best years of his life to win a fortune for his dot-
age. His tastes, and, more to the point still, his wife’s, remain 
inexpensive.  He  likes  to  see  his  flat  or  villa  furnished  with 
much red plush upholstery and a profusion of gilt and lacquer. 
But that is his idea; and maybe it is in no worse taste than is 
a mixture of bastard Elizabethan with imitation Louis XV, the 
whole  lit  by  electric  light,  and  smothered  with  photographs. 

— 386 —

Possibly, he will have his outer walls painted by the local artist: 
a sanguinary battle, a good deal interfered with by the front 
door, taking place below, while Bismarck, as an angel, flutters 
vaguely about the bedroom windows. But for his Old Masters 
he is quite content to go to the public galleries; and “the Ce-
lebrity at Home” not having as yet taken its place amongst the 
institutions of the Fatherland, he is not impelled to waste his, 
money turning his house into an old curiosity shop.

The  German  is  a  gourmand.  There  are  still  English  farm-
ers who, while telling you that farming spells starvation, enjoy 
their seven solid meals a day. Once a year there comes a week’s 
feast throughout Russia, during which many deaths occur from 
the over-eating of pancakes; but this is a religious festival, and 
an exception. Taking him all round, the German as a trencher-
man stands pre-eminent among the nations of the earth. He 
rises early, and while dressing tosses off a few cups of coffee, 
together with half a dozen hot buttered rolls. But it is not until 
ten o’clock that he sits down to anything that can properly be 
called a meal. At one or half-past takes place his chief dinner. 
Of this he makes a business, sitting at it for a couple of hours. 
At four o’clock he goes to the café, and eats cakes and drinks 
chocolate. The evening he devotes to eating generally — not a 
set meal, or rarely, but a series of snacks, — a bottle of beer and 
a Belegte-semmel or two at seven, say; another bottle of beer 
and an Aufschnitt at the theatre between the acts; a small bot-
tle of white wine and a Spiegeleier before going home; then a 
piece of cheese or sausage, washed down by more beer, previ-
ous to turning in for the night.

But he is no gourmet. French cooks and French prices are 
not  the  rule  at  his  restaurant.  His  beer  or  his  inexpensive 
native  white  wine  he  prefers  to  the  most  costly  clarets  or 
champagnes. And, indeed, it is well for him he does; for one is 
inclined to think that every time a French grower sells a bottle 
of wine to a German hotel- or shop-keeper, Sedan is rankling 
in his mind. It is a foolish revenge, seeing that it is not the Ger-
man who as a rule drinks it; the punishment falls upon some 

— 387 —

innocent travelling Englishman. Maybe, however, the French 
dealer  remembers  also Waterloo,  and  feels  that  in  any  event 
he scores.

In  Germany  expensive  entertainments  are  neither  offered 
nor expected. Everything throughout the Fatherland is homely 
and friendly. The German has no costly sports to pay for, no 
showy  establishment  to  maintain,  no  purse-proud  circle  to 
dress for. His chief pleasure, a seat at the opera or concert, can 
be had for a few marks; and his wife and daughters walk there 
in home-made dresses, with shawls over their heads. Indeed, 
throughout  the  country  the  absence  of  all  ostentation  is  to 
English eyes quite refreshing. Private carriages are few and far 
between, and even the droschke is made use of only when the 
quicker and cleaner electric car is not available.

By such means the German retains his independence. The 
shopkeeper  in  Germany  does  not  fawn  upon  his  customers. 
I  accompanied  an  English  lady  once  on  a  shopping  excur-
sion  in  Munich.  She  had  been  accustomed  to  shopping  in 
London  and  New York,  and  she  grumbled  at  everything  the 
man showed her. It was not that she was really dissatisfied; this 
was her method. She explained that she could get most things 
cheaper and better elsewhere; not that she really thought she 
could, merely she held it good for the shopkeeper to say this. 
She  told  him  that  his  stock  lacked  taste — she  did  not  mean 
to be offensive; as I have explained, it was her method; — that 
there was no variety about it; that it was not up to date; that 
it was commonplace; that it looked as if it would not wear. He 
did not argue with her; he did not contradict her. He put the 
things back into their respective boxes, replaced the boxes on 
their respective shelves, walked into the little parlour behind 
the shop, and closed the door.

“Isn’t he ever coming back?” asked the lady, after a couple of 

Her tone did not imply a question, so much as an exclama-

minutes had elapsed.

tion of mere impatience.
“I doubt it,” I replied.

— 388 —

“Why not?” she asked, much astonished.
“I expect,” I answered, “you have bored him. In all probabil-
ity he is at this moment behind that door smoking a pipe and 
reading the paper.”

“What an extraordinary shopkeeper!” said my friend, as she 

gathered her parcels together and indignantly walked out.

“It is their way,” I explained. “There are the goods; if you 
want them, you can have them. If you do not want them, they 
would  almost  rather  that  you  did  not  come  and  talk  about 
them.”

On another occasion I listened in the smoke-room of a Ger-
man  hotel  to  a  small  Englishman  telling  a  tale  which,  had  I 
been in his place, I should have kept to myself.

“It doesn’t do,” said the little Englishman, “to try and beat a 
German down. They don’t seem to understand it. I saw a first 
edition of The Robbers in a shop in the Georg Platz. I went in 
and asked the price. It was a rum old chap behind the counter. 
He said: ‘Twenty-five marks,’ and went on reading. I told him I 
had seen a better copy only a few days before for twenty — one 
talks  like  that  when  one  is  bargaining;  it  is  understood.  He 
asked  me ‘Where?’  I  told  him  in  a  shop  at  Leipsig.  He  sug-
gested my returning there and getting it; he did not seem to 
care whether I bought the book or whether I didn’t. I said:

“‘What’s the least you will take for it?’
“‘I have told you once,’ he answered; ‘twenty-five marks.’ He 

was an irritable old chap.

“I said: ‘It’s not worth it.’
“‘I never said it was, did I?’ he snapped.
“I said: ‘I’ll give you ten marks for it.’ I thought, maybe, he 

would end by taking twenty.

“He rose. I took it he was coming round the counter to get 
the book out. Instead, he came straight up to me. He was a big-
gish sort of man. He took me by the two shoulders, walked me 
out into the street, and closed the door behind me with a bang. 
I was never more surprised in all my life.

— 389 —

“Maybe  the  book  was  worth  twenty-five  marks,”  I  sug-

“Of course it was,” he replied; “well worth it. But what a no-

gested.

tion of business!”

If  anything  change  the  German  character,  it  will  be  the 
German woman. She herself is changing rapidly — advancing, 
as we call it. Ten years ago no German woman caring for her 
reputation, hoping for a husband, would have dared to ride a 
bicycle: to-day they spin about the country in their thousands. 
The old folks shake their heads at them; but the young men, 
I notice, overtake them and ride beside them. Not long ago it 
was considered unwomanly in Germany for a lady to be able to 
do the outside edge. Her proper skating attitude was thought 
to be that of clinging limpness to some male relative. Now she 
practises eights in a corner by herself, until some young man 
comes along to help her. She plays tennis, and, from a point of 
safety, I have even noticed her driving a dog-cart.

Brilliantly  educated  she  always  has  been.  At  eighteen  she 
speaks  two  or  three  languages,  and  has  forgotten  more  than 
the average Englishwoman has ever read. Hitherto, this edu-
cation  has  been  utterly  useless  to  her.  On  marriage  she  has 
retired into the kitchen, and made haste to clear her brain of 
everything else, in order to leave room for bad cooking. But 
suppose it begins to dawn upon her that a woman need not 
sacrifice her whole existence to household drudgery any more 
than a man need make himself nothing else than a business 
machine. Suppose she develop an ambition to take part in the 
social and national life. Then the influence of such a partner, 
healthy in body and therefore vigorous in mind, is bound to be 
both lasting and far-reaching.

For it must be borne in mind that the German man is excep-
tionally sentimental, and most easily influenced by his women 
folk.  It  is  said  of  him,  he  is  the  best  of  lovers,  the  worst  of 
husbands. This has been the woman’s fault. Once married, the 
German woman has done more than put romance behind her; 
she has taken a carpet-beater and driven it out of the house. As 

— 390 —

a girl, she never understood dressing; as a wife, she takes off 
such clothes even as she had, and proceeds to wrap herself up 
in any odd articles she may happen to find about the house; 
at all events, this is the impression she produces. The figure 
that might often be that of a Juno, the complexion that would 
sometimes do credit to a healthy angel, she proceeds of malice 
and intent to spoil. She sells her birth-right of admiration and 
devotion for a mess of sweets. Every afternoon you may see 
her at the café, loading herself with rich cream-covered cakes, 
washed down by copious draughts of chocolate. In a short time 
she becomes fat, pasty, placid, and utterly uninteresting.

When the German woman gives up her afternoon coffee and 
her evening beer, takes sufficient exercise to retain her shape, 
and continues to read after marriage something else than the 
cookery-book, the German Government will find it has a new 
and unknown force to deal with. And everywhere throughout 
Germany one is confronted by unmistakable signs that the old 
German Frauen are giving place to the newer Damen.

Concerning what will then happen one feels curious. For the 
German nation is still young, and its maturity is of importance 
to the world. They are a good people, a lovable people, who 
should help much to make the world better.

The worst that can be said against them is that they have 
their failings. They themselves do not know this; they consider 
themselves perfect, which is foolish of them. They even go so 
far as to think themselves superior to the Anglo-Saxon: this is 
incomprehensible. One feels they must be pretending.

“They have their points,” said George; “but their tobacco is 

a national sin. I’m going to bed.”

We rose, and leaning over the low stone parapet, watched 

the dancing lights upon the soft, dark river.

“It has been a pleasant Bummel, on the whole,” said Harris; 
“I shall be glad to get back, and yet I am sorry it is over, if you 
understand me.”

“What is a ‘Bummel’?” said George. “How would you trans-

late it?”

— 391 —

“A ‘Bummel’,” I explained, “I should describe as a journey, 
long or short, without an end; the only thing regulating it be-
ing  the  necessity  of  getting  back  within  a  given  time  to  the 
point from which one started. Sometimes it is through busy 
streets,  and  sometimes  through  the  fields  and  lanes;  some-
times we can be spared for a few hours, and sometimes for a 
few days. But long or short, but here or there, our thoughts are 
ever on the running of the sand. We nod and smile to many as 
we pass; with some we stop and talk awhile; and with a few we 
walk a little way. We have been much interested, and often a 
little tired. But on the whole we have had a pleasant time, and 
are sorry when ’tis over.”
